looks like hunting is what this build is about

apparently with wukong the strongest way to play jungle is: 
    camp a lane (focus on snowballing a teammate or shutting down a player)
    
    so he's a snowballer. I think this makes sense... he has very good damage early on. 

legendary items:
    turbo chemtank (health + MR + AH + MS. gives you a speed boost)     55 
    anathemas chains (health + AH, lets you mark a nemesis)             45
    bloodthirster                                                       17 
    gargoyle stoneplate (armor + MR)                                    73 
    statikk shiv (AD + AS + crit)                                       79

mythic item: 
    galeforce (gives move speed)                                        11
    iceborn gauntlet (defensive item but slows enemy)                   78 
    duskblade of draktharr (AD + AH + lethality)                        24

boots: 
    mobility shoes

the galeforce build is interesting... while you have mobility shoes, 
    in combat you have speed boost from galeforce / turbo chemtank
    so this would strongly emphasize roaming / ganking, which makes sense since he excels at sneaking up on people 

popular items to consider / evaluation: 
    black cleaver           69 
    divine sunderer         38 
    guardian angel          69
    sterak's gage           59 
    deaths dance            49
    maw of malmortius       27
    trinity force           92 
 
___________________________________________

my mythic item picks in order of frequency: 
    galeforce                   1
    duskblade of draktharr      2
    trinity force               3
    Eclipse                     4
    iceborn gauntlet            5
    divine sunderer             6

    so it really does look like galeforce is a great item, and duskblade too
