    frost feels that talon scales quite well 

general playstyle places a special emphasis on: 
    play for objectives (early dragon and riftherald)
    counter ganking (protect vulnerable laners from predictable aggressive junglers)

    talon is very mobile and can help his allies all over the map 
    talon can also try for risky objectives and escape quite easily 


you generally do scale well. 
    you should full clear while looking for picks in most cases, this seems to be the most consistent


legendary items: 
    winters approach 3          seems like more of a laning pick 
    ravenous hydra 1            improves his clear speed and ensures he's full HP when a fight breaks out / keeps him on map more
                                    he also has good survivability so should be able to keep stacks up if you play carefully. so makes sense
    edge of night 2
    titanic hydra 5
    prowlers claw 6
    steraks gage 4
    sunfire aegis
    chempunk chainsword
    

    items are much more health-oriented than what frost built 
        dice seem to indicate that's good too, not sure why though. dice suggest 2-3 health items 
        maybe in practice talon will just get blown up if he doesn't have this
