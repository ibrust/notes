there was another set of runes, but since it was rare to use I removed it. 
    but basically you'd take inspiration with unsealed spellbook / boots / minion dematerializer / cosmic insight + the same precision as secondary


I think I like ghost over flash... it'll help in his ganks more 


with rammus these should be your general playstyles: 

    1) ganking lanes (make ganks work across multiple lanes while farming)
    5) power farming (focus completely on yourself and only make plays with guaranteed payoffs)
    6) counter ganking (protect vulnerable laners from predictable aggressive junglers)

    you're not snowballing lanes, you're not counter jungling, and you really don't contest objectives that well since you can't duel well

    it's all about ganks / counterganks and farming
