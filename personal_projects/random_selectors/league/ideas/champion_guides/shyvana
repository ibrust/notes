99/100 games go AD shavana over AP apparently 
    maybe this changes in a future patch, we'll see 

avoid ganking or fighting pre-6 unless it's pretty clear it will work, 
    or maybe if it's during the leftover time at the very end of your first full clear (assuming you had a good leash)


with shyvana her playstyle is adaptable, and you can play in many ways 
    1) ganking lanes (make ganks work across multiple lanes while farming)
    2) camp a lane (focus on snowballing a teammate or shutting down a player)
    3) play for objectives (early dragon and riftherald)
    4) counter jungling (get a gold / exp advantage over enemy jungler)
    5) power farming (focus completely on yourself and only make plays with guaranteed payoffs)

    the only strategy she doesn't really excel at is counter ganking (protect vulnerable laners from predictable aggressive junglers)
        not sure why this is, maybe it's because she doesn't have alot of CC
            or maybe it's because she'd rather be farming early 
            or maybe it's because she has so much initiative with her ult that she should be leading the game 
    skill capped thinks shyvana shouldn't be ganking or camping a lane early against strong junglers, which makes sense to me
        but midgame this will become a viable option anyway
