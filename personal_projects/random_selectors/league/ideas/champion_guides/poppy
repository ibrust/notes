apparently you can build poppy in many different ways 
    if you get an early lead damage is more of an option
    but if not tanky is another good way 
    you can even build poppy with lethality apparently 

poppy doesn't scale that well apparently, so you do want to make plays in the early & midgame 
    though poppy does have alot of utility in teamfights she isn't going to carry the game into the lategame
