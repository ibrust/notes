for gameplan ivern is actually quite strong at level 6 in 1v1s
    he can quickly steal 1 camp from the enemy as well, but just 1, so that's something to bear in mind 
    he clears quickly so he has alot of gank time and a good stun / shield as well 

jungle paths: 

    wolves > blue > gromp > raptors > red > collect these 5 camps 
        > smite krugs 
        > smite skuttle (if enemy started red you should prioritize skuttle probably) 

        you have to do the gromp 3rd because it won't spawn in time otherwise 

    red > smite krugs > raptors > wolves > blue > gromp > collect these 5 camps > skuttle

__________

runaans hurricane vs nashors tooth analysis: 

0.7 AP scaling on his root 
0.2 AP scaling as bonus magic damage while in brush 
0.8 AP on the shield burst AOE damage 
0.5 AP on the shield strength 

0.2 AP on daisy's 3rd auto knockup 
0.15 AP on daisy's autos 

nashors tooth: 

	gives 100 AP, 50% attack speed, 15 ability haste
	Icathian Bite: Attacks apply (15 + 20% Ability Power) magic damage On-Hit
	costs 3200 

	____________________________
	+15 AD to daisy 
	+20 damage on her 3rd auto knockup 

	+50 shield strength 
	+80 damage when the shield bursts 

	these seem the most important to me:
	+20 bonus magic damage while in brush 
	+70 damage on his Q root
	icathian bite - 15 + 20% AP damage on it - so at least 35, probably more  

randuins hurricane: 
	40% attack speed 
	20% crit 
	7% movement speed 

	bolts are fired at 2 more enemies, and apply full on-hit effects 
	+ 15 magic damage on hit 

	
	with ivern you'll usually be in a team fight situation 
		so you should probably assume you'll be attacking multiple people at once 

	there's also the crit, the move speed, and the spread on hit effects ...
