at level 9 you should switch to the blue trinket on eve, apparently 
    pre-6 the red trinket is good, but after level 6 you will get spotted if you use it while walking over a ward and invisible, apparently 
    evelynn can only be seen by control wards, not regular wards 

mechanics: 

    if you're looking to quickly one shot someone fzfrost thinks you generally don't full charm 
    but he thinks full charm is good in ganks 
        it's a question of time. if the full charm is doable it's generally worth it he says
            if you come from behind it's more doable, for example 
        also the slow is more valuable if your laners can also gang up on the person, and if they aren't close to escaping 

    Q - this targets the enemy you last dealt damage to. so if you were to Q an enemy, then auto a different enemy, Q will target the different enemy 

    Q + W, fast slow - pressing Q then W while the Q is in midair can proc the charm slow from a distance. 
                           for this to work you'll need enough range 
                       If you were to press W then Q it would take longer since you can cast the Q while moving 

    flash + E - a quick way of getting on top of a squishy to begin combos if you need to 

    you can charm people from outside vision range 
        so something you can do is sneak behind the enemy laner and press W
        they will start retreating, but they'll be walking toward you 
        you can even back up and remain out of vision range while they retreat, then surprise them 

    
    walk up to someone > Q > E 
        you use Q first here because Q causes the next 3 abilities to do bonus damage. Which means E will do bonus damage 
        (this dealt about 50% more damage in his demo - 240 instead of 160 - he was level 6)
        Q then E is also slightly faster 

    
    Q > E > auto attack > Q > Q 
        max damage combo without ult 

 
    Q > E > auto attack > Q > Q > ult 
        max damage combo with ult 

    
    W from max range > flash or backwards ult > E 
        this allows you to get your charm off on far away opponents 

    
    Q > proto belt active > E > ult 
        this is a fast damage combo with the proto belt active
