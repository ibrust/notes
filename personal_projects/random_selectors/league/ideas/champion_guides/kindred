as kindred you shouldn't really be ganking early unless it's really good.
    If there's a specific reason you need to camp a lane then that might be justified
    But generally you should focus on farming, counter jungling, and getting objectives.
    but of course if a good gank or counter gank presents itself go for it

blue > gromp > wolves > red 
    one pro on skill-capped likes skipping raptors because he thinks it's not worth the time investment 
        instead you can gank top or mid

    get the trinity force 2nd or 3rd in this build ... 
    I think you can actually get guardian angel / bloodthirster earlier ... 
    we'll see how that works out

REPLAY NOTES 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

    replay 1:
        kindred did a blue side clear > red > wolves, but didn't do golumns.
            I think this was because mid was low, and it gave her an opportunity to either gank mid or do skuttle next 
            she used a little time to place a ward in the blue jungle while waiting for skuttle 
            then jarvan rank right into her bush, headed for skuttle, and she killed him 
        
        kindred was effective in getting kills early because she had range against jarvan, who was melee but didn't have a good CC 
        
        first items were hearthbound axe / sheen (for trinity force) 

        kindred had a weak mid lane partner 
            so she actually wasted some time on ganks that didn't work, probably just to protect the midlaner 
        I also noticed that a strong midlane was key for allowing kindred to invade the enemy jungle on either side for marks 
            she was ganking midlane throughout the early game. even her starting route was designed for this 

        in the midgame kindreds top / bottom lanes started dying. 
            when this happened she ran and covered the wave while they respawned, and protected the tower from the enemy 

        she also waited for the enemy jax (who was a bit fed) to pounce on her ally, then attacked and killed him 2v1 
            her ult is a good way of protecting a low ally, making it useful in these 2v1 situations against a fed enemy 
        
        in a potential team fight situation kindred was poking an enemy who didn't have CC
            but using Q to jump backwards when they pursued 
            they targetted her, but then she could make good use of her ult. 
                I bet with bloodthirster or guardian angel this could be strong 
        

    replay 2:
        kindred took the red jungle companion this game instead of green like last game 
    
        the team with kindred invaded early. I was surprised to see the kindred playing so aggressive. 
            but I suppose kindred is relatively strong early compared to some other champs due to her range advantage 
            also her level 3 seems pretty good 
    
        I noticed players often get wards first, but change to sweeping lense after their first back 
            I saw a kindred sweep the bushes while setting up for a gank 
            she also did the preemptive portal while watching for the gank. it didn't work out and she just went back instead 
                this seems like a good way to minimize time lost while ganking 
        
        this game kindred farmed alot more early, and started invading / ganking midgame. 

        there was an interesting gank in the river near bot
            kindred got ambushed but killed the enemy jungler in a 1v1 
            kindred then retreated up to the high ground, but reengaged by jumping over the high ground at one point. 
                this use of high ground for defensive / offensive purposes was interesting 
            
            kindred jumped over alot of walls this game - dragons wall (from the top), the golumns wall, etc. 

        after kindreds team got an advantage she started counter jungling.
            the supported warded the enemy jungle very well with control wards here. but I also saw kindred with control wards 
            while kindred was farming the enemy jungle she was also hovering near enemies pushing the lane, waiting to protect them
