wukong jungle ideas: 
    looks like hunting is an important aspect of this 

    legendary items:
        turbo chemtank (health + MR + AH + MS. gives you a speed boost)     55 
        anathemas chains (health + AH, lets you mark a nemesis)             45
        bloodthirster                                                       17 
        gargoyle stoneplate (armor + MR)                                    73 
        statikk shiv (AD + AS + crit)                                       79
    mythic item: 
        galeforce (gives move speed)                                        11
        iceborn gauntlet (defensive item but slows enemy)                   78 
        duskblade of draktharr (AD + AH + lethality)                        24
        
        I think Eclipse and Stridebreaker also look interesting

    boots: 
        mobility shoes

    this build is interesting... while you have mobility shoes, 
        in combat you have speed boost from galeforce / turobo chemtank

    popular items to consider / evaluation: 
        black cleaver           69 
        divine sunderer         38 
        guardian angel          69
        sterak's gage           59 
        deaths dance            49
        maw of malmortius       27
        trinity force           92 

    early epic item ideas:

        bramble vest 
        serrated dirk 
        recurve bow         (can build into blade of the ruined king)

___________________________________________

my mythic item picks in order of frequency: 
    trinity force               3
    divine sunderer             6
    galeforce                   1
    iceborn gauntlet            5
    duskblade of draktharr      2
    Stridebreaker               7
    Eclipse                     4

    so it really does look like galeforce is a great item, and duskblade too
