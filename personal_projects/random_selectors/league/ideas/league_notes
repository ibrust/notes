MISC INFO 
--------------------------------------------------------

skuttle spawns at 3:30 as of patch 13.15

the first camp you kill will respawn at 4:40 

first dragon spawns at 5:00. 
    dragons respawn 5 minutes after the previous dragon is defeated 
first dragon type is random. 
    second dragon will always be different type than the first dragon
    third dragon will always be different type than the first and second 
    from here onward all dragons will be the same type as the third dragon 

    the first team to kill 4 dragons gets the elemental soul buff. 
        six minutes after the elemental soul buff is received an elder dragon will spawn
            an elder dragon will then respawn every 6 minutes after it's defeated 
        elder dragon buffs are very powerful 

    most junglers can solo the dragon at around level 5 

there's a blast plant that spawns on the cliff behind the dragon. if you're on the bottom team you can use it 
    it spawns between 5:00 and 5:30 
    you can use this to jump into the dragon pit and take the dragon quickly 

waves take about 25 sec from when they spawn to meet in the middle

    1) mentality:
        think of your game as a 1v1 against the enemy jungler.
            if you get ahead of the enemy jungler it opens up alot of possibilities for you 
        think of decisions you make in terms of the gold and experience it brings you 
            try not to waste time helping noobs if they die anyway
        your plans need to be very flexible. don't have a static mindset in a changing environment 
            your only definite plan prior to the game is the buff you choose to start at 
            you always have to react to the information seen on the map 
            your entire route should be reactive
    
    2) jungling theory 
        when you gank there ideally should be a camp up to fall back on if it doesn't work 
        if you can steal the enemy camps this is high value since you both deny them camps and gain more 
        he feels rift herlad is the most important objective since it gives good gold and snowballs by taking towers 
            and in low elos you can time this and take it right when it spawns 
        be careful not to waste time doing ganks that don't get kills 

    3) useful things 
        a) the champion icons above the map show you your teammates HP bars 
            if these are low HP you know there have been fights in that lane 
            this is a quick and easy way to get an idea of what's happening in the lane 
        b) try to look at the minimap between each autoattack 
            this helps you to make the ideal decisions 
        c) use information from the scoreboard
            it tells you levels, items, and CS 
            if the jungler shows himself you should check his CS 
                based on the junglers CS you can tell what path they probably took 
                every camp on the map is worth 4 CS, including dragon / herald 
        d) use F keys to quickly look at allies champions & their lanes
        e) use the game timer, know all the timings 
            1:25 - late invade timing 
            1:30 - first camp starts 
            1:45 - level 2 gank or invade 
            3:30 - skuttle spawns / junglers naturally cross the river 
                    so if you get an early kill often you'll recall at 3:00 to buy & contest skuttle 
            3:45-4:00 - recall to base and reach your first regular camp respawn (assuming you started on a buff)
                        remember that regular camps have 2:15 timers, and buffs have 5:00 timers 
            4:20 - respawn of your the first non-buff camp you killed (i.e. if you red > krugs, krugs respawns at 4:20)
            5:00 - dragon, and camps spawn on the second side of the map cleared during a full clear 
            6:00 - first buff respawns in 45 seconds from now (so you can plan to steal the enemy buff, or rebase / take your own again)
            6:40 - first buff respawns 
            7:00-7:15 - rebase to prepare for taking rift herald (if you rebase earlier you can setup vision, etc.)
                        you can also recall earlier than this and clear a quadrant near rift herald, then transition to rift herald
            8:00 - rift herald spawns 
            14:00 - turret plates fall off 
            20:00 - baron spawns 

            you can make gameplans around where the enemy jungler is likely to be based on these timings 
                i.e. they'll probably be near dragon at ~5:00, you can kill them at buff respawn if you're stronger, etc. 
            
        4) categorizing types of jungler champions (some may fall into multiple categories)
            a) strong level 1 invaders
                champions strong at level 1. also consider what their rune was (i.e. conquerer is strong early)
                also take a look at their teammates level 1 strength 
                you can get a general idea of their level 1 invade potential 
                examples of strong level 1 champions: 
                    kindred, graves, nidalee, others

            b) strong level 2 gankers or invaders 
                champions that can gank or invade when they get red buff at level 2 
                examples of strong level 2 champions: 
                    graves, lee sin, kindred, nidalee, vi, elise, others 
                with these champions you must be aware if they start red, and if there's a vulnerable lane they could gank afterwards
                    they could also invade you, and you have to lookout for that 
                    if you're weaker at level 2 against these champions warding your 2nd buff for the invade is vital 
                        if they do invade you can either steal their jungle or get your laners to rotate and kill them 

            c) level 3 champions 
                pretty much every jungler in the game can make some kind of play at level 3
                some do want to just keep farming more 
                    still there may be opportunities for even them to make plays at level 3 
                but some junglers (like sejuani, zac, rammus) provide alot of utility with their 3 abilities,
                    and it's standard for them to gank at level 3
                    if you're an aggressive jungler you may want to countergank them here 

            d) farming junglers (those that don't want to gank at level 3)
                certain champions prefer to just farm up to level 6 (evelyn, shyvana, hecarim, etc.)
                if you're an aggressive jungler you may want to invade them during their farm  

            know when the jungler has their power spike, and when you have your power spike 
                know when you have the advantage, and when they do 
                so create a doc where you categorize the junglers into one or more of these categories 
            
            when you're selecting champions, if they've already chosen a jungler, you should these things too 

            if you're the stronger jungler it's often good to start red buff 
                because this gives you alot more options for invading them or ganking lanes 
                and if you're a weaker jungler it's also good to start red or raptors to deny them the invade
                    raptors is better if you're afraid of a late invade, otherwise red is pretty standard 
                    but it's okay to start blue if you have strong laners near red 
                        since they may be able to rotate and help you if you get invaded
            
        5) misc advice 
            ping and tell your team where the enemy jungler starts
                if you can't tell it's often red or raptors 
            note that for the top team and you take red first, 
                your red will respawn just before rift herald, so this can be a nice timing 
            if the enemy starts at blue and you start red this strengthens your level 2-3 invade, you'll have the red buff advantage 
                try to get a good leash if you're doing this, it'll speed up your arrival time 
            krugs give the most exp of any camp. gromp is also good 

            try to think alot more about whether you can invade their jungle early based on where they start / the jungle matchup 
                or whether they can invade you and what you're gona do about it 

            vertical jungling may be more advantageous if it pushes you toward an easily gankable lane / pushes them away from one 
                so this can also justify an early invade, since their counter jungling won't be as good for them     

            throughout the game always be asking yourself if you beat the enemy jungler 1v1 
                if you do then look for ways to contest them at the important places on the map     
                    
            waves arrive in lane every 30 seconds. 
                i.e. a wave will arrive at about 2:00, 2:30, 3:00, etc. 

                it's when the wave arrives you'll know how the enemy will choose to handle it 
                    but you don't want to arrive to gank too late, where the wave has already been dealt with 
                    so generally you'd like to start pathing toward the gank like 5 seconds before it arrives


--------------------------------------------------------
THE ESSENTIALS OF JUNGLING 
--------------------------------------------------------

    ---------------------------- 
    THE 1 MISTAKE HOLDING YOU BACK FROM RANKING UP
    ----------------------------

    they claim that for everyone below master the mistake is wasting time forcing ganks or plays that are obvious won't work
        its alot of time, and time is gold / opportunities elsewhere 
        it also reveals you on the map, giving the enemy jungler an information advantage 
            the information advantage can lead to stolen camps, objectives, and kills on your laners 

    so wasting time on failed ganks is the top priority to fix. 
        they claim you must adopt a policy that unless you feel it's an 80% success rate you shouldn't do the gank 
        you need an obvious reason to justify a gank 

    when determining whether a gank will work be sure to factor in the hero levels

    one strategy is to move toward a lane and jungle camps near it while monitoring it, waiting to see if a good opportunity presents itself 


    ---------------------------- 
    HOW TO PLAY AROUND BAD TEAMMATES AS A JUNGLER 
    ----------------------------

    at low elo play the game in a way that doesn't assume your team will play in a specific way 

    make plays that will work regardless of how your teammates execute 
        (this seems to imply that farming junglers are preferred at low elo since the ally won't engage reliably when you gank)

    and look for plays that are flexible, and can go in many different ways 

    ping your ideas but give up on them quickly if it's clear the team isn't responding 

    in one game he recalled, but his team wouldn't back off from a bad play on bottom 
        so assuming they'd all die by the time he got bottom again he went and took 2 towers on top 


    ---------------------------- 
    BEGINNERS GUIDE TO JUNGLE 
    ----------------------------

    on your first back usually you want to swap your starting trinket for a sweeper lense
        I'm not entirely convinced this is correct, since by the time you find the ward they'll already know you're there
        but I'll keep an open mind about it

    early on be cautious when ganking a lane with a ton of enemy minions, 
        sometimes the minions can actually allow the enemy to 2v1 you

    one strategy for how to play the midgame (level ~7) is to path toward lanes where available camps are nearby 
        this lets you choose between ganking and taking the camps 

    to get behind rift herald wait until it auto attacks you. 
        herald will sit still for a bit, giving you time to move behind him 
        also dodge the big windup swing 
    
    while the first scuttles provide 80% reduced experience, skuttles after that provide good experience 

    consider invading the enemy jungle when you're stronger than the enemy jungler / your nearby laners are available 

    if you see the enemy jungler on the other side of the map it often means you can make a play on your side,
        because you'll have a numbers advantage on your side 
        this is called cross-mapping 

    ---------------------------- 
    TRACKING ENEMY JUNGLER 
    ----------------------------
    standard time for laner to show in lane after leash:
        1:46-1:54
    also check mana and health of laners to see if any is missing 

    also know the standard starting routes for different junglers
        this might vary by elo too 
    and know the common routes (see the jungling routes section)

    since camps respawn in the same order they were initially taken in, 
        knowing the starting path also lets you predict where they'll begin their 2nd route 

    you can also track the jungler by checking their CS when they reveal themselves
        each jungle camp actually gives +4 to your CS count (including scuttle)

    camps generally take 10 seconds with smite, 15 seconds without smite 
        walking between nearby camps within a jungle typically takes 5 seconds 
        crossing the middle takes about 10 seconds 
        running from fountain back to a camp takes about 20 seconds 
        but note these times vary between champs 


    good wards in the blue jungle: 
        1) between blue / gromp 
        2) in the bushes near blue 
        3) in the bush between mid and wolves (place it near the top of the bush - harder to place this ward)
    good wards in the red jungle:
        1) out in the open between wolves and red 
        2) in the brush naer the tower next to wolves (harder to place)
        3) on cliff above dragon (easier to place - often gives good info on gank routes) 
        4) in reds bush (better for tracking farm)
        5) bush between red and the enemy base (harder to place, but good info)
        6) brush between two bot towers (hard to place, but can place while ganking)

    ----------------------------
    CREATING A GAMEPLAN AS JUNGLER 
    ----------------------------

    there are 6 general plans for the first 15 minutes worth considering: 

        1) ganking lanes (make ganks work across multiple lanes while farming)
        2) camp a lane (focus on snowballing a teammate or shutting down a player)
        3) play for objectives (early dragon and riftherald)
        4) counter jungling (get a gold / exp advantage over enemy jungler)
        5) power farming (focus completely on yourself and only make plays with guaranteed payoffs)
        6) counter ganking (protect vulnerable laners from predictable aggressive junglers)

        different junglers favor certain strategies over others 

        you should decide on which plans to go with based on the matchups 

        if your enemy has only AD or only AP you should avoid taking risks and just get MR or armor and you'll win 

        the choice of whether to freeze or push a lane after a gank can also tie in with your overall gameplan 
            if they're all AP and you have a long term scaling advantage it may be better just to freeze the wave, for example 

        apparently camping a lane is viable if you have a 1v5 champion on your team such as Yi or Kassadin
            because if you can snowball the lane it can make your team win 

        if your enemy jungler is strong early it discourages ganking or camping a lane 
            but counter ganking becomes more viable 
            counter ganking is a more selfless style jungle. it can be successful, but you could also be wasting your time

        look for if your lane matchups are very volatile and/or their jungler is gank-heavy early 
            these games often come down to the success of ganks / counter ganks 
            spending too much time farming in these lanes can result in a loss 

    ----------------------------
    THE ULTIMATE GUIDE TO PINGING 
    ----------------------------

        don't assume your ally knows what you intend to do. ping beforehand 
            this communicates your intent. pinging is essentially communication 
        
        if you show on one side of the map this leaves the other side vulnerable to ganks 
            this is a good time to ping your laners on the other side of the map and tell them what to do 
            so lets say your laner on that side is pushed in. here you should give your team a warning ping 

        you shouldn't wait until it's too late to give caution or warning pings 

        if it's important and the person isn't responsive don't just ping once, ping repeatedly
        
        make sure you use the right ping / location to clearly communicate intent 
            for example, pinging danger on top of your ally ensures they'll see the ping 

    ----------------------------
    6 THINGS I WISH I KNEW WHEN I STARTED JUNGLE 
    ----------------------------

        1) how to cover waves
            as a jungle you should do everything possible to influence your lanes possibly 
            need to know understand lane states. for example, know if the lane is frozen, pushing, or neutral 

            and don't let waves crash into the tower if no one is there - your team loses gold / exp this way 
                pay attention to when your laners leave their lanes or die so you can cover the lane  
                    sometimes you may roam with them but this is situational 
                laners get more gold / exp than junglers so if your laner is roaming alot it's okay to cover 
        
        2) how to hover dives correctly (loiter near or cover an ally that's about to be dived / needs to recall)
            if you neglect to help your lanes your ally might lose the lane, which has consequences for your whole team including you 
            and remember how punishing a tower dive is when the wave is crashing on it 
                in addition to the death it denies gold / exp of the wave 

        3) trading objectives
            if you can't contest an objective don't try and die 
                instead give it up and play for something else on the map 
                i.e. push towers and take plates, clear camps or take objectives on the other side of the map, etc. 
        
        4) avoid hesitation 
            if you're torn between multiple different ideas just choose one, don't waste time figuring out the best option
            even a slight delay may delay / just mess up what you choose to do
                and if you delay you won't know whether your plan would have worked out if you had gone with it more quickly 
            by just choosing you also will force yourself to play on instinct, honing and pushing your skills to the edge 
                you'd rather play on instinct, and study after you play the game 
    
        5) do not be results based 
            you may play well but lose, or play poorly but win 
            but you should still analyze your wins and losses for places you can improve 
            for example, people often don't analyze their wins because they feel good about them and don't criticize them 
 
        6) how to fix problems once you've identified them 
            sometimes people know what they need to fix but they still don't do it 
            you should try systematic, focused improvement on one aspect of the game at a time

    ----------------------------
    6 BEST TIPS FOR JUNGLE IN SEASON 13
    ----------------------------

        1) hit the rift herald eye 
            whenever the eye is hit it closes for 10 seconds, 
                then that time is reduced by 2.5 seconds whenever rift herald is hit by a basic attack 
                however, the eye will remain closed for at least 3 seconds, and won't open when rift herald is below 15% health 
            therefor you should wait to hit the eye when herald is about 30% health 
                hitting the eye damages 10% of heralds max health. add your smite to that. that's when you should hit the eye / smite 

        2) even though herald is good against low HP towers due to true damage, 
            you shouldn't use it if the tower is going to fall anyway. this is just a waste of the herald 

            try to use herald before 14 minutes to get plate bonuses 
            also, the mid tower is the most important tower and hardest to take down, 
                so if you can take it with herald down that's good
        
        3) it's often good to let your teammate initiate the fight during a gank rather than showing yourself 
            if your laner just doesn't go in... he recommends not going in either. you can just do something else / not waste time 

            your laner going in first makes the enemy blow cooldowns before they see you, meaning they can't react to your gank 
            the fight also distracts them and they may not notice you going in 
    
        4) scan bushes for wards when going for a gank 
            alternatively you can use your opponents reaction to your presence in the bush to infer whether they see you 
            and if you do scan and see a ward don't stop to kill it unless the gank is already going to fail 

        5) if you're waiting in a bush for a gank you should start your recall 
            if the gank doesn't open up as you expect you'll have a faster recall 
    
        6) do not ignore minion waves
            they can be one of the best sources of experience 
            you can even sit in nearby bushes to get experience from minions 
            levelups give 2+ kills worth of stats apparently 
    

    ----------------------------
    HOW TO CLIMB EACH RANK & ESCAPE YOUR ELO AS JUNGLER 
    ----------------------------

    there are some big, main things that people at different elos can focus on to improve 

    he used to advise that people optimize their clear first to save time. 
        this is less important with the new jungle pets. differences in clear time may be like 5 seconds now. 
        it still matters with some champions, and you can reduce health lost too, so you can work on it at some point 

        bronze)     biggest problem at this level is going for ganks that do not work, wasting time or dying 
                        so to fix this you should exclusively focus on ganking, working on identifying which ganks will work 
                        one of the best ways to do this is to work on reading body language of the enemy you're ganking 

                        also make sure you are looking at lanes while you're farming. 
                            otherwise you won't learn how to read the lanes 
        
        silver)     in low elo the jungler often always starts at the bot lane for the better leash 
                        they aren't thinking about the lane to gank and choosing their jungle route based on that 

                        ganking lanes where you have a fight advantage helps 
                        and ganking a losing lane if you also have a losing jungle matchup can be disasterous 
                            if you lose the duel you wouldn't want to start bot and head top if the enemy also was starting bot. 
                            you'd just be moving toward a losing lane with a losing jungle matchup 
                            if the top lane / jungler are coordinated they can even invade & bully you out of your jungle in these scenarios 
                        
                        he actually recommends moving toward lanes where your allies have better early wave clear than the enemy 
                            since you will have lane priority and allies can rotate to clear objectives 
                        he also recommends heading toward lanes where your ally is ranged and the enemy is melee
                            you'll have a fight advantage this way 
                        maybe these recommendations are just for silver players, I'm not entirely sure.
                            because other more detailed ganking guides give different advice on where to gank 
                            a ranged champ may just deny farm and push the enemy back under their tower 
                            these do sound like good ways of predicting who will win lane, though 
                        and pathing toward lanes where the enemy has a non combat spell like teleport, or where your ally has ignite 
                        
                        if you win the duel against the jungler try to path into the opponent, and if you lose it try pathing away 
                            in low elo usually your opponent will start on bot, but not always
                    
        gold)       you need to apply two important concepts here: 
                        1) holding abilities to account for enemy options 
                        2) adjusting gank paths to account for enemy options 
                    
                        for example, you may refrain from using an ability or ganking knowing the enemy has flash 
                        
                        in general your play is now taking into account what the opponent can do 
        
                        you also need to choreograph your ganks better 
                            alot of low elo players just right click and span abilities
                            but you need to know the sequence of moves and when to use each move 
                        
                        it's also important to remain hidden on the map 
                            so you need to start thinking about how to avoid being seen
                            the enemy not knowing your location applies pressure to them 

                            once you decide not to do a gank it's important that you not show yourself on map
                                don't go into a lane 
                                don't pass through bushes that are likely to be warded 
                        
                        learning all the champions moves sounds like it will help alot here 

        platinum)   now you'll have to be constantly thinking about time management and tempo 

                        for example, death timers are very short in the beginning of a game 
                            so after an early kill on the enemy jungler it may be better to recall immediately to keep tempo
                            this will allow you to continue to apply pressure on the enemy jungler 

                            so generally learn how to avoid late recalls 

                        learn how to be places on time

                        even if you die you gained tempo through returning to base, and you must use this to your advantage 

        diamond)    don't play to avoid losing, play to win 
                        and don't fear your opponents or give them too much respect 

                        watch replays and study the way the good players take risks, are more aggressive taking dives, taking camps, etc. 
                            the window to make plays and impact the game is very narrow in diamond, even a few seconds matters
                            so play on instinct and push yourself 


    ----------------------------
    WHY YOU SUCK AT THE LATE GAME AS A JUNGLER 
    ----------------------------

    farming after laning phase is important, you don't want to stop doing it. 
        but you still need to read the situation and decide whether you need to be near the team 

    in general, you should farm when your team isn't ready for a team fight,
        and be near your team if they're in a position to team fight, or securing an important objective 

    your team shouldn't team fight if they have less people available 
        but if they still do, one thing you can try is not following them, but pressuring a nearby tower
            this might force the enemy to react to you 
            it may also mislead them into thinking more of your team is near you 
            but for this to work the tower push needs to be an immediate threat 

    in general the concept of counterplay does apply 
        i.e. it's good to have pressure in multiple places at the same time. 
            your team can back off from one location you push the other, for example.
    
    be sure you're placing wards consistently, and deep into their jungle 
        and use control wards, too 

    when setting up objectives it's very important to secure the position / a time window 
        this is often done through vision / warding 
        but pushing a wave for the objective can also achieve this 
            pushing the wave significantly restricts the paths your opponents could take to the objective, since minions provide broad vision 
    
    so the main things are: 
        1) playing around your teammates 
        2) looking for alternative ways to create pressure other than going to fight 
        3) pushing out waves for objectives 
        4) knowing when your time to farm is 
        5) consistent deep warding 

    ----------------------------
    WHY YOUR KDA IS GOOD BUT YOUR WINRATE ISN'T 
    ----------------------------
    
    junglers often fall behind in levels in the midgame 
        so it's important for them to know how to snowball their leads to take advantage of their kills 

    to snowball a game you must: 
        1) accelerate the game as much as possible 
        2) punish enemies to the max potential 
    
    sometimes in high elo people are looking to scale and play for late game (i.e. feed the ADC) 
        but in low elo this isn't a reliable approach, since it relies more on your teammates not screwing up
        also your impact and control over the game generally reduces as the game goes on 
        it's better to just snowball it 

    one good way to snowball is to take objectives / towers. this helps your entire team 
        you can do these things in the window after kills 
    another good way, if you can out-duel the enemy jungler, is to invade 

    low elo junglers play non-interactively 
        when they get leads they go back to farming instead of capitalizing on their leads 
        when ahead you should be in the enemies face, pushing towers, taking objectives, etc.
    
    there are also power spikes in the game that you should be aware of, 
        and jungler matchups may favor one champion over another 

    the rift herald should be used to its max to kill enemy towers 
        rift herald removes 2 plates from a tower with true damage 
        towers gain significant armor as they die, so the last plates are harder to break 
        this means herald is most efficient in killing the last 2 plates. 
        so you can actualy time the herald use for when the tower has 2 plates left 
            time using herald when between 2.5 and 3 tower plates remaining, depending on how fast it's being damaged 
    
        you will get more out of herald if uncontested 

        tower plates plates fall off at 14 minutes. 
            they give armor & magic resist to the tower.
            they added tower plates to prolong the laning phase. 
            you get gold for killing the plates 
    
    you may not always be able to get more off a kill 
        but capitalizing on your kills is an essential part of winning

    ----------------------------
    HOW TO STOP THROWING YOUR LEADS 
    ----------------------------
      
    if you get an early lead on the enemy jungler try to capitalize on your tempo 
        so be aggressive in stealing his camps / dueling him
        
        be aware that when the enemy recalls or dies they may rebuy
            after taking their camps / skuttles you can consider recalling / buying to setup stealing their camps again 
            you can keep tempo this way

        if you keep up the pressure and continue to deny him camps you can starve out the enemy jungle this way 

        another example of keeping tempo is skipping dragon to opt for stealing more of the enemy camps 
            it doesn't matter if you're skipping some of your sides camps if you're denying the enemy jungler his camps 
    

    ----------------------------
    THE SECRETS TO COMING BACK AS A JUNGLER 
    ----------------------------

    when behind you should consider taking more risks

    look for counterplay on different sides of the map when you're behind 
        for example, instead of contesting a losing objective look for opportunities to make a play elsewhere 
        it can also be smart to play near your strong allies 

    the team that's ahead has to snowball their lead. otherwise over time the game may slowly equalize 

    taking risks for shutdown gold can be a good strategy 
    also you can try to kill a higher level player 
        if you kill someone higher level than you it gives you more exp, helping to close the level gap 
    another good way to equalize the level gap is to cover waves 

    they claimed that actually loses you tempo in the early game, but didn't say much more about it 


    ----------------------------
    THE SECRET TO JUNGLING IN LOW ELO 
    ----------------------------

    in low elo players are asking to die all the time. the trick is recognizing the opportunity and capitalizing on it 
        it's important to read the body language / small interactions to judge whether a gank will work 
            interpret what the enemies goal is and you'll get a read on how long they're likely to remain where they are 
            usually people won't change their behavior until prompted by something 
            i think learning different roles will help this intuition
        
        you can use body language to infer whether they've warded a bush and noticed you in it 
    
        if you spot the enemy jungler on the other side of the map this is a sign that a gank will work, 
            since you won't be vulnerable to a counter gank 

        note that if you only use the mini map to look for ganks, and don't move your screen to see them, you can't read body language 
            there's also other important information you'll be missing out on
            so it's important to practice moving your screen to different locations as you're jungling 
            maybe try using the F keys to cycle through your allies and see what's going on 

    --------------------------------------------------------
    THE INSIDE OUT RULE 
    --------------------------------------------------------

    league is more about decision making than mechanics 
            you need to know where to be in order to win games and carry 

    the inside out rule is to change the order inwhich you consider plays on the map 
        you typically look for these plays during time windows 
        first consider plays on the map that are nearest to the enemy fountain, and work your way back toward your fountain 
        your brain naturally looks for safe, closeby options 
        but the highest value and most punishing plays are the ones nearer their fountain 

        you shouldn't take risky or bad plays near their fountain, you should just consider them first 

    some lanes are non-interactive after a certain point 
        this can be due to champions that are hard to gank / just farm 
        so to make a play in these lanes you need a time window 

        here are common ways to get a window of time ahead of your opponent so you can make plays:
            pushed waves (you can push them yourself in lane, as jungler adjacent pushed lanes also create windows)
            after a fight when enemy recalls or is dead (look at their timer lengths)
            spotting an enemy on the map and knowing they're far away

        in these windows try to execute the play that will have the most impact without being risky 
            start from the enemy side of the map when thinking of what to do
                like stealing jungle, doing dragon / herald, ganking another lane, setting wards deeper in the jungle, etc. 
                if the window is long enough sometimes you can do multiple of these 

    --------------------------------------------------------
    THE TRICKS TO MAKING CORRECT DECISIONS FAST 
    --------------------------------------------------------

    when you get invaded a counter invade / ward placement near enemy camps can be powerful 
        it's also good to take sweeping lense afterwards & check for wards they may have dropped in your jungle 

    look for opportunities to check the minimap 
        walking between camps 
        while fighting camps but abilities are on cooldown 

    the further a lane is away the higher risk it is to run to gank it, since the lane may change by the time you get there
        so the first decisions to consider are what to do about lanes nearby 

    when a laner has pushed it mainly means two things: 
        1) they're more vulnerable to a gank 
        2) they have a window where they can make plays / react to things better 

    when considering information to make a decision, try to rule out / ignore any information which you couldn't use / respond to anyway 
        stay focused on the information that's relevant to your next move 

    when considering whether to countergank try to figure out if your ally is in danger 
        their positioning and health matter
        their level, the matchup, ward placements, and whether they have flash also matter 
        the enemy junglers level also matters alot 
        also ask yourself whether you'd actually win the 2v2 if you counterganked 
            otherwise you may just waste your time and get double killed 

    in deciding whether to tower drive there are 2 main flags to look for: 
        1) whether the enemy is low on health - that way you can still kill them under the tower 
        2) your side has a big wave going into the tower 

        you must also ask where the enemy jungler is and whether they can countergank you 

        you can also jungle a nearby camp, but drag it toward the potential countergank location while waiting to see if their jungler comes 
            this is useful if you're not really sure if the gank will happen, or your laner has relatively high health (you'll have time to get there)


    avoid revealing your location as jungler, this will make it harder for your enemy jungler to make decisions

    there are 2 main conditions that allow you to invade the enemy jungler: 
        1) being stronger (check the items and level. also if they recently recalled they probably bought items)
        2) having lane priority (so laners don't collapse on you)

        also note that often in a countergank the enemy jungler burns thier abilities in your laner, 
            leaving them more vulnerable to you for a short period 


--------------------------------------------------------
MASTER IN MINUTES - WARDING 
--------------------------------------------------------

after the 2 enemy mid towers fall, the most important ward in the game apparently becomes placing a ward between the 2 dead enemy towers 

when you base, if you buy sweeeper lense > buy back stealth ward, the ward cooldown can get reduced. 
    this works because ward cooldown is based on level.
        if you leveled up since you placed the last ward you will get an improved cooldown. 

apparently control wards disable enemy wards 
    and apparently you should place a control ward at objectives to ensure enemy wards do not see you doing them 

you can place a ward in the brush above both the dragon pit and the baron if you do it right 
    you have to step in a certain place and hover your mouse over the edge of the brush 

apparently control wards don't expire, so if you hide them in good places they will remain there quite a long time 
    there's 2 good places for early control wards:
        a) the brush near the blue wolves that allows you to see people going to do wolves 
        b) the bush past the enemy red camp (can still monitor the red from here but less it's likely to be seen)

deeper vision is important. warding deeper into the enemy jungle lets you see the enemy / react to their movements more quickly 

when you kill a yellow (stealth) ward, vision lasts there for about 5 seconds. so consider going a different direction to confuse them 
    but when you clear a control (red) ward vision is lost immediately 

if you click on a ward it tells you who placed it. 
    this can be useful if you see a ward get placed over a wall but aren't sure who placed it. 

the ward near the raptors on the hill is very strong against junglers early 
    most junglers do the raptors. you can also see where the jungler goes to next with this ward. and it's not too hard for the mid to place 

a stealth ward at the very back of the dragon / baron pit is a good way to monitor the objective  
    and a control ward must be placed just inside the pit to deactivate this ward. if placed outside the pit the control ward won't reach 

    it's necessary to place these control wards if the objective is important or could be contested. 
        also dragon will more often be warded

there are actually ways for laners to place wards in key brushes by hovering their mouse over walls and placing the ward
    this allows them to avoid having to walk up to the brush 

you should make your spells quick-cast, but your wards normal-cast. this lets you place the ward more precisely 
    the cursor will show different colors when you're hoving over brush, for example 

    the lone river brush is one ward people often screw up 
        if you place your ward in the center of the brush it won't see the full ramp coming from raptors 
        so place it hugging the edge of the brush instead 
    
if standing in the enemy brush at top / bottom, if the minions attack you as they approach you, it lets you know there's a ward there 

--------------------------------------------------------
THE 30 SECOND RULE 
--------------------------------------------------------

this is the idea that you should understand whether you'll have an advantage 30 seconds in the future, and base a decision on that 
    
    an example given was in the bottom lane after getting an early kill on the enemy. 
        the enemy buys an item and returns quickly (short death timer)
            so it's important to push the wave and recall to buy items / restore health 
            otherwise the enemy will have an advantage on you 
    
    in another example he got a kill in an early invade, but then was low health on tower and his jungler wasn't in a position to help 
        if he'd put off basing to not miss XP this would just mean he couldn't farm. there wasn't hope of him winning lane by waiting 
        so an early base, though he missed CS, was better than waiting. 
            here it allowed him to buy items / return and pressure the lane, getting a kill 
    

--------------------------------------------------------
THE BEST JUNGLE ROUTES TO KNOW IN 2023
--------------------------------------------------------

common routes: 

    red 3 camp > transition gank mid    red > krugs > raptors > transition gank mid 
    red 3 camp > gromp > gank top       red > krugs > raptors > gromp > top 
                                            remember with these 4 camps you start with a 3 camp, then choose to do this
    red 3 camp > gromp > gank mid       red > krugs > raptors > gromp > mid 
                                            I just don't really see the advantage of blue with all the mana regen from pets 
    red 5 camp > gank top               red > krugs > raptors > blue > gromp > top 
    red full clear                      red > krugs > raptors > wolves > blue > gromp)

    blue 3 camp                         blue > gromp > wolves 
    blue 4 camp                         blue > gromp > wolves > red 
    blue 5 camp                         blue > gromp > wolves > raptors > red 
    blue 1st full clear                 blue > gromp > wolves > raptor > red > krugs)

    fastest level 3 > gank top              red > raptors > gromp > top 
                                                the fast level 3 works because gromp gives you alot of xp 
                                                this ends up being a versatile route
                                                it's good on junglers that have strong early games and don't want to just full clear 
    fastest level 3 > invade red            red > raptors > gromp > gank enemy red 
    fastest level 3 > blue > gank top       red > raptors > gromp > blue > gank top
    fastest level 3 > blue > invade red     red > raptors > gromp > blue > gank enemy red 
    fastest level 3 > blue > gank mid       red > raptors > gromp > blue > gank mid 

    fastest level 3 > blue > wolves         you can do wolves if no options are available 
                                                after this you can take either skuttle, invade the red jungle, or gank top / mid - it's versatile 
                                                downside is you skipped krugs in this route 
                                                    but some champions don't really want to sit back and full clear (including kindred apparently) 

uncommon routes: 

    raptors first                      can allow you to invade enemy blue side next (can gank at gromp or steal camps)
                                            also lets you avoid early red gank 
                                            you also prevent your allies from leashing, which hides your location 
                                            but it's inefficient - the respawn order is thrown off
                                            also low elo people often don't notice the leash location anyway

    blue > gromp > red                  this can be used on champions that have a strong level 3, and don't intend to full clear but instead gank 
                                            this lets you get bot faster too, which may be useful 
                                                like if the enemy jungler do a fast level 3 gank on bot and you want to counter gank 
    

    
    late invade enemy red               wait in the tri brush (lone river brush), move in at 1:20 or a little later 
                                            ideally you want to find the enemy jungler and kill him here, not just steal the red 
                                            so since junglers often start bot side this isn't as effective for the top team to do 
                                            and alot of junglers seem to start blue in general 
                                            
    late invade enemy blue              not as strong as invading red since the terrain is less favorable, 
                                            there's not the same convenient brush, you can get spotted easier and the enemy can escape easier 
    
    enemy raptor start                  you wait in the tri brush and move in at 1:20 or a little later 
                                            this leads into some interesting followups 
                                            if the enemy started red you can sometimes gank them there while they're still fighting it
                                                leashes are stronger on red for the bottom team, making this less likely if you're top team 
                                            if they started blue you can just steal their red 
                                            this is best with a strong early game champion with good clear on raptors that also are strong at lvl 2 
                                            it's a risky route but it's surprising 
    
    red > level 2 blue invade           best when used with junglers that can jump the red buff wall who also have strong lvl 2 
                                            save your smite, if enemy started blue you fight them at gromp. 
                                            try to get a good leash for this 

    red > raptors > blue invade         only works on champions that can clear raptors fast enough to still reach enemy gromp in time 
                                            apparently this is good with kindred against weaker farming junglers  


standard farming route: 

    full clear starting on top > 
        kill bottom skuttle > recall > buy control ward / get sweeping lense 
        2nd partial to full clear depending on timing > 
        at 5:10 kill dragon (use control ward / sweeping lense here) >
        3rd clear just the top > 
        kill rift herald 

    note that if you full clear > immediately recall > 2nd full clear you can get to your camps a little earlier than they respawn 
        for this reason people often first do a gank of bottom or top here. 
            this gank can be on bottom or top, before or after recalling
        i'm not sure exactly how much time you have, whether this is even worth it will depend on your clear speed, but it's only like a quick ganks worth 

    shyvana was the example champion used with this farm clear, and it looks strong, since she wants dragon and farm 

    this route is very easy to execute if the enemy starts on the bottom side, 
        since this will often mean he isn't there to contest 1st skuttle / the dragon 
        
        if the enemy also starts top and is in a position to contest the 1st skuttle, if you don't beat him 1v1, 
            quickly recall and get an item advantage / take the other skuttle so you don't get double skuttled 
            and you may have to be careful at the dragon

invades are rarely worth it if you only get a buff, apparently 
    to make them worth it you need either a kill, or to take multiple camps 
    this seems especially true with blue buff, because pets now keep you full mana anyway 

    note that being invaded also often gives you information on the enemy teams location 
        this allows you to counter invade without them knowing, and you have an information advantage 
            you know they took your camps, but they don't know you took theirs 
        

--------------------------------------------------------
GANKING LIKE A PRO 
--------------------------------------------------------

there are 4 important ganks to be aware of:

    1) gank against a low health champion 
    2) transition gank 
    3) gank against enemy without flash 
    4) ganking to help setup a recall timing for your laners (if they're low on health / mana)
        you'd do this if your ally was too low to push their wave and recall 
        before you engage be sure you'll win the fight though, if your enemy is too low they may be unable to help 

you can move your camera to check the lanes while walking in between camps 
    but while busy doing a camp watch the minimap for overlapping icons, this indicates trading (though people can trade without overlapping too) 

the guy says if you see an enemy below 20% health you should immediately move toward that lane intead of killing camps 
    this is obviously situation, but in the replay he analyzed the jungler quit raptors in the middle of farming them and headed for midlane 

watch for if an enemy burns their flash (during a gank or otherwise), or if they don't gank flash 
    this increases the odds of a gank working 

if the enemy wave has more minions it means the wave will be pushing in, assuming your ally isn't overly attacking the minions 
    this means a gank should be possible soon

remember to start on the opposite side from where you want to gank. 
+analyze the lane matchups and whether a gank is likely to work as follows: 

    1) analyze the CC and mobility of your team 
        mobility helps your ally to engage with you, increasing kill probability 
        CC helps secure the kill 
    2) analyze the CC and mobility of the enemies 
        mobility and CC both help them escape  
    3) consider whether the route on the way there will give you red buff during the gank, and whether you need this buff 
    4) consider whether their flash is down, or if they didn't take flash 
    5) predict who will be pushed up the lane or have low health
        5a) if both champions are melee the lane is likely to be volatile 
        5b) a ranged champion has a wave clear advantage over a melee, and that lane will likely get pushed 
        5c) two ranged can result in a more boring lane 
        5d) abilities also provide wave clear, especially AOE abilities 


after a kill in lane you have to decide whether to push the wave in 
    if the wave is already pushing toward the enemy then you should push it in
    figure out where the wave will be if you left it alone vs pushing, and to which laners advantage this would be 
    
if you track the enemy jungler well you can predict if he'll gank a lane if your laners are low on health 
    this can be a reason to counter gank 

the enemy jungler's position is also relevant to where you direct your ganks. 
    if the enemy jungler is on the opposite side of the map it means your ganks will go uncontested
    you also may be able to steal their jungle camps or other nearby camps uncontested 
 
if your minions end up fighting the enemy minions under the enemy tower the lane often rebounds back. 
    the reason is enemy minions will out live your minions. 
    after some time passes the enemies minions will accumulate and the wave will push toward your tower 
    this is assuming your laner doesn't push the wave back 

direct your play around gankable lanes throughout the game 
    some people play around what should be winning lanes, using the lane priority to secure objectives and do ganks.
        this works at higher elo, but it means relying on your teammates too much at low elo. 
    so instead focus on gankable lanes where your allies have mobility CC, or the enemy lacks mobility / CC 

you can actually place a ward right where the red spawns from over the wall. this lets you monitor red 
    though I actually like the ward at raptors instead of red, since it sees more.
    I also like my blue ward over the wall from the bush 

    if you know your opponent starts red you have the option of starting red and then immediately invading their blue jungle 
        this split-map scenario can be good if your bottom lane is the gankable lane you want to focus on 
        this works even better if bot gives you a leash on red, since this usually results in the enemy pushing the bottom lane in too 

note that if your jungler has a long range ability you can sometimes annoy an enemy trying to rebase by delaying them repeatedly, buying your team time

although you usually gank the opposite side you start on, there are sometimes opportunities to gank the same side you start on 
    this would be completely circumstantial, but if an enemy is pushing deep and low on health it can work 
    but note that by doing this you reveal yourself on the map and give the enemy jungler an opportunity to invade / steal your jungle camps 
        so you should only do this if you're sure the gank will work

--------------------------------------------------------
SECRETS TO STOMPING THE EARLY GAME 
--------------------------------------------------------

You can't just focus on making plays and winning the game through your own efforts 
    You have to also focus on what your opponent can do. 

    in one example a jungler showed on the map and executed a successful gank, 
        but the enemy jungler saw Jarvan on the map and this prompted him to execute a successful gank on his side too 
        so the net outcome was an even trade and no benefit to the successful gank 

        in this scenario the jungler should have pinged the other side of the map before he ganked 
        on average, when going in for a gank, gold players ping their laners 2 seconds in advance. challenges ping 10 seconds in advance
        throughout the game you track the enemy jungler, and if you predict a play that you can't counter you should ping for awareness 

    you need to find the play that prevents the opponent from doing what he wants 
        counter ganking / counter jungling are both examples of this 

        in one example the enemy jungler was ganking a lane and we couldn't contest since we could't win the fight 
            but we did steal the camps she had available to fall back on after the gank 
    
    if both junglers are fed it means the jungler messed up 

    if your laner dies to a gank you from the enemy jungler should ask yourself whether you could have tracked the jungler and predicted this 
        then decide whether you could have countered it or pinged it 


    when making decisions based on your laners priority in low elo you can't assume they will help you 
        you could make the right call and yet they could still do nothing 
        you might ping them 10 seconds ahead of time and they may not understand what you need, or just decide not to do it 

        teamwork can and does happen, you just can't rely on it 
            you need to have contingency plans if they don't help 
            for example, while in the enemy jungle killing camps you could not use abilities that help you escape quickly 

            you can also slow fighting in scenarios where the enemy could collapse on you, 
                keeping the getaway option, not fully chasing / going in until you know you have the backup 
            
            
    when the enemy is threatening something, if you can't stop them, sometimes you can threaten something equally or even more important 
        it's natural to try to directly deal with the threat, but sometimes you need counterplay instead 
    
        for example, if the enemy is stealing your red and you can't stop him you can consider just stealing his 
            or if the enemy is ganking a lane you can't reach you can try ganking a nearby lane or pushing a nearby tower 

            you also need to know when to trade an objective (like dragon) for a counter attack on towers / taking a herald, etc. 
        
        
    try to play the entire map as the jungler, and play it against the enemy jungler 
        this sometimes means not looking just 1 move ahead, but multiple moves ahead 
        it also means knowing what the lane priority is / where the enemy jungler is and how safe you are to make plays 

        you can analyze the opening in terms of different types of jungle matchups and strategic scenarios and slowly learn what the right moves are 

    certain strategic scenarios likes invades, stealing enemy camps, etc. have a set of predictable followup moves 
        for example, if you steal the enemy blue then go do your red the enemy will have no choice but to gank or try to take your skuttles / blue 
            so for you to do krugs here would be the wrong move. you need to go to your far skuttle / blue quickly and take them 
        knowing the correct followups from either side in these different strategic scenarios is an important part of jungling 

    
    in solo you must ask yourself what your teammates will next and craft your strategy around that 
        if you just assume they will do the right move and they don't you could be in trouble 
        but if you synergize with their questionable plays they at least won't feed as hard and you may be able to make the play work 
        though if it's a really bad play you should't do it 
        
        being aware of what they will do will also give you ideas of what to do, or what not to do
            if you know you can't rely on their backup then you may not make a play that leads to you feeding 

        whether you take skuttle or which one you take is a good example of this 
            if your laners don't have priority or won't rotate to help you it will effect your decision of whether you contest skuttle 

        another example is positioning yourself to respond to potential problems that could befall your allies 
            for example, if an ally is low health you can jungle some camps near them, or wait in a nearby bush 
                when the enemy comes to gank you can countergank
            another example is when your ally is roaming dangerously, you can position near them so you can respond if a fight breaks out 
        
        
        in one game an aggressive enemy jungler (shaco) started raptors, and from that our jungler knew the enemy would go red > krugs > gank top 
            this is a very typical, predictable way of playing shaco 

            so our jungler took his blue camps, then went to the other side and took shacos blue camps 
                while shaco got a kill top, the lane wasn't that important - shacos ally was a malphite 
                meanwhile this counter-jungling denied shaco any followup farm 
                shaco fell behind in levels and after a few more similar plays our jungler was able to keep up the pressure / starve him out 

        in another game the enemy jungler (gragas) cleared his top red side and ganked top, then recalled 
            karthas had started blue and was clearing his raptors / red. 
            karthas then responded by taking the bottom skuttle, then the top skuttle, then doing a full clear again 
                so he double-skuttled the enemy while the enemy was busy ganking, basically 

        
        there are some general rules to go by in league. for example: 
            1) don't play around your losing lane s
            2) don't fight when down numbers 
            3) play on the side with the objective 
            4) after your first recall return to the side you started on 
            5) start on the side opposite where you want to gank 
            6) you should recall when you have alot of gold

            but there are certain times where you have to disregard the rules 
                to do this ask yourself why the rule exists, then it will be clear when to disregard it 

            consider rule 4 above. you want to return back to your initial camps right in time for them to respawn 
                but what if before your recall you had a very successful gank where the enemies burned their flashes? 
                    and lets say this gank took more time, and your camps on that side will already be respawned by the time you get back? 
                        and then the wave is rebounding back off their tower, leaving them vulnerable?
                        in this case it'd be better to return to that side to follow-up gank again 

            consider rule 6 above. the idea is you don't want to take a fight if you aren't at full power since you could die 
                but what if you are far ahead enough, or a better dueler than the enemy jungle, or your laners have priority - so there's no such risk?
                    in this case recalling could actually have an opportunity cost, like missing out on counter jungling 

            
        even though raptors give less exp / gold than any other camp they're one of the best camps to do 
            this is because of their proximity to other things on the map 
        they're also the safest thing to steal from the other team 
            from the enemy raptors you have 2 very strong gank routes that bring you right behind the enemy laners 
            so if you get there and the raptors are gone it's not a big time waste since you can just divert to gank 

        
        in the early game wasting time instead of recalling quickly to buy items can leave you weak and unable to respond to plays on the map 
            so if you have nothing to do be sure to recall quickly to buy items 

        one common misconception is that you should always path away from lanes that are pushing 
            by doing this you're allowing the enemy jungler to kill your laners uncontested 
            sometimes you can instead contest skuttle or dive the tower in these cases 
                though be careful to not waste time here 
        
            
--------------------------------------------------------
HOW TO READ YOUR OPPONENTS MIND / THIS IS WHY YOU MISS FREE KILLS 
--------------------------------------------------------          

whenever a new wave arrives (every 30 seconds) the opponent makes a decision for how to handle the wave - recall, push, freeze, roam, etc. 
    at low elo it usually takes them a bit longer to make this decision, and they make it on the fly.
        at higher elo they may already know what they're going to do in advance  
    
    you should time your ganks to occur after they've locked themselves into a decision on how to handle the wave 
    also be aware of how many minions they have left to kill. once the minions are dead they'll decide again how to proceed 

    you should be constantly monitoring the lanes you're pathing toward to see how they've chosen to handle the wave 
        this is why your jungle path has to be adaptive. 
            if you see they're committed to a wave and there's a gank opportunity you can adjust course 

--------------------------------------------------------
3 LEVELS OF JUNGLING: BEGINNER TO PRO 
--------------------------------------------------------   

when ganking remember not to click toward the enemy, but click to cut off their escape path 
    also the way you approach should hug the wall nearest their escape path so that you cut them off better 

think carefully about the order inwhich you should use your abilities 
    anticipate the opponents escape mechanisms (i.e. dashes / flashes) and figure out the correct order inwhich to use your abilities 
    it may help to get to know all the champions and analyze replays to figure out the correct plays 
    watching pro replays may also help 
    
    also, realize you don't have to use all abilities immediately if they have long cooldowns 
        i.e. you might wait to use Wukong's dash until the opponent begins escaping since it has a long cooldown

--------------------------------------------------------
TEAM FIGHTING 
-------------------------------------------------------- 

in the startup screen you should identify every CC / ult / other noteworthy ability the enemy team has 
    in team fights you will largely be playing around these abilities 
        it seems like a good way of understanding the fight in general 
    ADCs especially have to be aware of the CC abilities since it prevents them from kiting 
        and knowledge of the CC / ults will also dictate how you play the laning phase, and how you gank lanes 

watching alot of replays can be a good way to develop an instinct for team fights 

some principles for ADCs (and others) to follow in teamfights: 
    1) play around vision 
    2) play around your frontline 
    3) use your max range
    4) play around cooldowns, especially CC / dive abilities 
        you should know the different champs and their abilities, and figure out a strategy for the teamfight
    5) know the biggest threats and play around them 
    6) auto attack as much as possible 

some common mistakes ADCs (and others) make in teamfights: 
    1) not understanding the enemy team composition, and your team comps win condition. this effects how you should play the fight
    2) do not initiate bad plays. your teammates at low elo will followup, and if the teamfight isn't a good idea it's disasterous 
    3) don't use important abilities until you know you'll get good value out of them 
    4) avoid tunnel vision. watch for changes (deaths, dropping low, repositioning, using abilities etc.) in your team / the enemy team
    5) try to hold off on using key abilities that you don't need to use. they may be more useful later 

as an ADC let your teams bruisers / assassins take out the back line while you take out the front liners 
    you also need to stay near your team as an ADC, you're alot more vulnerable when alone 
    so when kiting try to stay near your team, or keep them between you and the enemy, if possible

be aware of who the super-fed champions are and play the teamfight with that in mind 

when your team takes dumb fights don't suicide by following them,
    and be very careful not to lead your teammates into a bad fight. 

in low elo you can let your teammates do something stupid to bait out the enemy abilities, then engage afterwards 
    engages can be good, but in low elo it relies on your bad teammates following up 
    so there's actually a deincentive for you to initiate in low elo 
    instead you can let a dumb teammate initiate, especially if you're the one who's fed and will do damage 
    basically adopt a mentality of using your bad teammates as cannon fodder 


there are 3 things you should setup for teammates once the laning phase ends. this will help tip teamfights in your favor: 
    1) numbers advantage - you can get a numbers advantage by killing an enemy, 
            but also by reducing an enemy to low HP and forcing them to recall, 
            or by just noticing the enemy is on the other side of the map 
    2) lane priority - this secures a vision and tempo advantage.
            this can secure you a window to take an objective.
            midlane priority is especially important 
    3) vision control - it will just give you the jump on the enemy and increase awareness / coordination 

when you have a numbers advantage you can force a fight. it's common to do this by taking objectives. 
    similarly with lane priority this can buy time for objectives 

try to setup an advantage before you teamfight. forcing even number fights with no clear advantage is unreliable

know what your champions role is and who your targets are / how you should play the teamfight. 
    also know when your champion has a power spike, and when the enemy champions have their power spikes 
    i.e. rammus is strong in midgame but falls off late game 
    
assassins are good at 1v1s and squishies against squishies.
    so with an assassin you generally wouldn't want to attack an enemy rammus, for example 
    a good move with assassins is to anticipate when a squishy will be rotating through jungle and hide in a bush / catch them 

    also, CC is the main counter to a melee assassin since it will stunlock you and kill you 
        so one thing you can do is wait until the enemy uses their CC abilities to jump in 

    it's generally better as an assassin to be patient, wait outside of vision and go for an isolated high priority target
 
    generally assassins don't even want to be grouped up with their team when the fight breaks out, they want to be flanking 
        so try to take routes that lead you in behind the enemy backline instead of through their frontline
        flanking makes your abilities easier to land, and lets you get on the squishies more quickly 
        the assassin may even be pushing an adjacent lane or doing a nearby creep camp 
            you generally want to be late to the fight instead of early (at least according to this person) 

    you need to know the right target, and this means knowing the biggest threat 


as a mage you're very squishy 
    it's important to let your tanks lead, and to give them a bit of distance, not to tag along right next to them 
    you want to make sure you're in range to respond to a fight, but not close enough to get caught by any CC 

    when someone on your team is hit with an ability the enemy will often look to followup by moving forward 
        as a mage this is often a good time for you to attack the enemy with your abilities 
    
    it's rare that flashing into kill someone is worth it in a team fight if it loses your life 
        if the enemy is low they're already mostly out of the fight, but you need to stay alive to deal more damage 

    knowing who the biggest threat against you is is very important, it helps you determine how to position yourself
        but you do also have to take advantage of mistakes in the enemy positioning as well 

    sometimes restraint is justified in a team fight situation if you already have significant advantages in the game 
        it's better not to risk dying if you don't need to 

    know which abilities to save for defensive purposes. if you burn everything on offense you may be left helpless 

    when trying to land skillshots against mobile champions wait for them to use any mobility abilities before using the skillshot

    note that it can be very effective in some teamfights to cast spells over walls, since the opponents won't see them coming 

    also if you're a squishy mage play near the ADC so you can both focus anyone that gets onto you 


before a fight you need to judge the fight and how it should go 
    consider positioning, ultimates, abilities, levels, vision, how fed people are, current health, total people at the fight, etc.

    this also helps you know when it's time to fight. for example, if you can force a fight while you have an advantage it's good 

--------------------------------------------------------
BASIC LANING PATTERNS  
-------------------------------------------------------- 

    reasons to freeze a wave: 
        1) you can win duels even with a minion disadvantage, and want the enemy to have to come forward to hit minions 
        2) you forced enemy to recall or killed them, but don't have time to fast push the wave into tower
            by not killing minions quickly their minions will kill more of yours, denying the enemy experience 
        3) if it will leave the wave in a more gankable position and you think your jungle may gank 

    
    when slow pushing, you fast push the wave once you know that you won't be able to add more waves of minions to it before it crashes 

    the advantage of slow pushing is the enemy is stuck clearing the minions at tower. 
        meanwhile you're free to do whatever you like, such as:
            1) roam
            2) recall
            3) invade
            4) clear vision
            5) take objectives
            6) gank
            7) dive                 note that if you dive & trade 1 or 1 it's advantageous since you deny the enemy the big minion wave  

        the big wave also gives you a fight advantage while you're building it, since you have more minions 

    fast pushing is useful if you ever need to leave lane quickly for any reason 

    after waves get pushed into tower they will bounce back 
        if the minions die on tower before the reinforcing wave arrives the next minion wave will meet again in the middle, resetting the lane 
        but more often the minions on tower will disrupt the reinforcing wave, and afterwards the wave will start to slow push back

        you can utilize a bounce off towers to setup the next wave in a way that's advantageous to you 
            if it's your tower the wave is crashing into you have an opportunity to setup as low push 
            if it's the enemy tower / the wave is bouncing back toward you you can choose to freeze the wave
        
--------------------------------------------------------
SMURF COMENTARIES - JUNGLE   
-------------------------------------------------------- 

    after you take down mid tower place a ward where the tower was. you can see everything with it 
        you have to anticipate this play and swap out your sweeper lense for the warding trinker

    --------------------------------------------------------
    JUNGLE CHAMPIONS  
    -------------------------------------------------------- 

    best team fighting jungle champs (in order): 
        rumble 
        gragas 
        mordekaiser 
        zeri 
        rell 
        skarner 

    master Yi is a great duelist 
        he's also very strong in teamfights 
        he can be weak against CC since it interrupts his heal
        he's weaker in the early game before he gets items, too 
        he scales well but needs alot of gold to be good at high elo, so bear that in mind 

    nocturne is also a great duelist 
        his level 6 ganks are extremely strong and an important power spike 
        he can dive the backlines very easily in teamfights 
            other dive champions synergize well with him since you won't be focused so easily 
        he also has very fast clear speed 
        he falls off some late game 
        he also has a very all-in play style, once you dive you can't get out 

        you can build him lethality or bruiser
            lethality is better if you're getting kills / you're dominating early / mid game / you have important targets to take out 
            bruiser is better if the enemy team has kills and you need survivability / it's going to go late game as an even game 



--------------------------------------------------------
THE COMPLETE BEGINNERS GUIDE TO ADC
-------------------------------------------------------- 

there are 4 general types of ADCs according to skillcapped: 
    1) utility - ashe, varus, jhin
    2) mobility - ezrael, lucian 
    3) hypercarry - twitch, jinx, kogmaw, aphelios, vayne 
    4) lane bully - draven, miss fortune, caitlyn 

    utility types are more team oriented.
        they don't deal the most pure damage but have strong CC / engage / AOE abilities 
    mobility types are just ADCs with alot of mobility. 
        these are less vulnerable than other ADCs and they can engage / disengage, and take on enemies more easily 
    hypercarry types are very hit or miss. they're very team dependent since they're very vulnerable, lacking defensive spells / mobility. 
        but they just have insane damage output 
        they don't have play making potential on their own due to their vulnerability. 
        you have to play them patiently and let your team engage
    lane bullies dominate the early laning phase and want to snowball their leads

    note that not all ADCs dont fall under just one category. 

    your laning phase is very reliant on your support. 
        the support usually dicgtates the pace of the lane since they have the most influence due to their early strength 
        so you can't always be the one to initiate engages

    there are 2 basic types of supports: 
        1) melee supports - alistar, thresh, leona 
            these like to engage 
        2) ranged supports - lulu, soraka, seraphine
            these like to poke / support you more 

        you need different gameplanes based on the type of support you have. 
            if you have a melee support:
                try to push the wave slowly / keep it on your side of the lane 
                    this means your enemy will be further from their tower, and if your support engages they'll have to run farther 
                at the same time you keep the enemyw ave thin enough (dont let it get too massive) 
                    so that when you do engage you won't have to deal with tons of minions attacking you 
            if you have a ranged support: 
                be aware they're very frail 
                their abilities are often skillshots which are harder to land 

                if you can keep a larger number of minions it'll make it harder for the enemy to engage you 
                    and by pushing the wave you also reduce the enemies minions, which makes landing skillshots easier 
                    so you often do push the wave when you have a ranged support 

        while the initiation of a fight is usually your supports responsibility, the setup of the fight is the ADCs 
            so utilize the various laning tactics to make it most likely fights will go in your favor 

        still, there are two times you can initiate attacks: 
            1) when the enemy is last hitting 
            2) when your opponents aren't parallel to one another 
                ideally you want to be standing parallel to your own support 
                    this allows you to both respond if one of you gets in a trade with the enemy 
                so if your opponents aren't standing parallel / aren't in a position to back one another up in a trade you can attack 

        also note that if your support is not standing parallel with you it often means you have to back off, since you're vulnerable 

        in the middle game, after the laning phase, ADCs typically move to the mid lane 
            unfortunately in solo queue people will often all come into the mid lane and you won't get good experience 
            so look for waves in the side lanes and collect them 
            and take free jungle camps if it doesn't look like the jungler will get them 

        

--------------------------------------------------------
SMURF COMENTARIES - ADC  
-------------------------------------------------------- 

as an ADC it's not really your job to create opportunities, but to capitalize on opportunities your team creates 
    and you should never try to force a play as an ADC. if your frontline backs off you must back off. 

during teamfights staying at max range and only running in to attack at the perfect moment is very important 

pay special attention to the enemies that can CC you. 
    against a bruiser that can engage you with CC (such as Vi) edge of night is quite strong 
    against a mage with CC a banshees veil or a stopwatch / zhonyas hourglass is good 

enemies that can zone are something to be very aware of ADC as well 
    you have to know when you can / can't auto attack 

be sure to understand your power spikes / the enemies power spikes and play around that too 
    know how many items your enemy has compared to you. know what thier build path is and when they're likely to get an item 

it's important to practice kiting as an ADC to ensure you survive in various fight situations 

before attacking it's also very importnat to consider what abilities your enemies / allies have up / down 
    this is even true in large teamfights if important ults are down

if the enemy jungler is starting red on bot side be mindful of early ganks

be aware of when the enemy has exhaust up or down. this effects your decision to fight 

when you have priority in lane you have more of an ability to engage 
    likewise when you lack priority you have to be more mindful of a potential engage 
    it seems like people will secure early lane priority with an early trade in mind 

    --------------------------------------------------------
    ADC CHAMPIONS 
    -------------------------------------------------------- 

    draven is a strong early game champ and lane bully - he does tons of damage even from level 1 
        he also has very good mobility since he can chain speedups 
        though he scales decently he needs to snowball early to really carry
        if he's on your team you want to gank and help him snowball, if he's on the other team you'd gank to prevent him from snowballing 

    sivir is a waveclear champ and scales / team fights well. she also has good burst damage 
        she's an okay duelist, especially if you have a CC support / a minion advantage. 
        but she does have shorter range than other ADCs, so can still have a weaker early game
        it seems good to do the "cheaters recall" strategy with sivir, assuming you can secure priority / aren't against a very aggressive comp  
        in team fights her ultimate gives the whole team a movement speed boost. 

    kai'sa is very mobile, has alot of burst as well as good sustained damage, and scales well 
        but she has below average attack range 
        her early laning phase is a bit harder due to her range disadvantage, she has to be played more aggressively. 
        as she scales she becomes one of the best ADC duelists and is very mobile in teamfights
        she can do alot of damage quickly so does well with a CC support 

    lucians burst damage is very strong early 
        he's hard to kill since he he's very mobile with his dashes 
        he's also a good duelist 
        he has shorter range though
        he also doesn't scale as well as other ADCs 

    twitch is considered decent in lane and scales well in the late game 
        he's very good in team fights (2nd to ashe) cuz he does a ton of AOE damage. 
        he can also act as an assassin at times with his cloak 
        he prefers prolonged fights where he can stack up his poison damage 
        apparently it can be good to poke him or make short engagements
        if he gets caught without cloak he doesn't have a good escape mechanism 

    aphelios is one of the weakest champs in the game at level 1 because he has no ability 
        it improves at level 2 but he's still vulnerable vulnerable throughout the early game since he no mobility 
        he's generally countered well by poke and range
        his characteristics vary based on the weapon though
            he doesn't fight that well with his initial 2 weapons apparently. when he exchanges them he gets better at fighting 
        he does do good burst depending on the weapons selected, 
            and scales well into the late game to do alot of damage with chakrams or infernum 
            he is also very versatile 

        the green gun gives him range and is good for poke
        the red gun causes his attacks to heal / shield him 
        the purple gun applies slows / roots 
        the blue gun does AOE damage 
        the white gun fires faster when closer to the enemy, so it's like a dueling meleeish weapon 

        green + purple gun combo is good for long range roots 
        blue + purple gun combo is good for AOE roots
        red + white is the best dueling combo 
        white + green allows them to deploy a turret and then run away while still shooting you 
    
    ashe has good poke in the laning phase 
        her auto attack range is 600 which is more than most 
        she also has good CC and slow 
        she's the best teamfighter ADC in practical terms since she has good mass slows / good range / CC with her arrow 
        
    caitlyn is a poke champion and has the longest auto attack range in the game at 650
        she has good burst 
        she can safely bully most laning opponents. she wins most lanes. but she needs to snowball this
        she scales well but has a bad mid game apparently 
        she often slow pushes instead of force pushes because she wants to harass the enemy in lane 
            and she also has enough range to harass the enemy under tower 
        since she's often push forward she's often vulnerable to a jungle gank 

    ezrael has a strong mid game 
        he's also very safe in lane since he has an escape mechanisms 
            and he's very mobile in teamfights 
        he's skillshot reliant so he can struggle against mobile champions 

    jhin does high damage throughout the whole game. it's not necessarily upfront damage - his 4th shot is always a crit that deals execute damage 
        he also has some long range abilities, including a super long range ult 
        he's good at kiting with his speedups too 
        and his lotus traps on the ground are invisible

        he lacks mobility early so vulnerable to gank
        he is skillshot reliant so can struggle against mobile enemies

    jinx scales very well in the late game, but has a weaker early game 
        she has good wave clear and push potential 
        she has a little self-peel with her traps, but is generally reliant on her team for safety 
        her speed boosts on takedowns are significant in team fights 

    kalista is very mobile and good at kiting, so might be harder to gank 
        her rend can do good damage 
        whether she's strong is matchup dependent apparently 

    kogmaw is the strongest scaling hypercarry in the game if he's protected, he does the most DPS 
        he does good hybrid damage 
        he shred through tanks since he has a max health damage ability 
        he also has very high range 
        his weakness is he has no mobility and has no CC, only a slow 

        he does well against scaling bot laners since he will just outscale them. 
            he has a harder time against lane bullies. he's probably a good gank candidate as well 

    nilah has alot of AOE damage with her abilities and her ult
        she also has alot of survivability via life steal / heal / a dodge ability
        so she's strong in teamfights 
        but she's a melee champion and gets lane bullied easily, though she has an ability that gives her slightly more range
            but she needs a support with range or CC to either zone or peel for her 
            her auto attack range is 225 but her Q increases it to 350 temporarily 
        in the early game she just wants to survive lane 
        in team fights and in lane you generally follow up on your team mates engages rather than initiating yourself, and you don't chase

    samira is melee and can have difficulty against lane bullies. 
        she also has difficulty against alot of CC. 

        but she is good at getting on top of scaling ADCs with weak early games,
        and she's considered extremely good in teamfights.

    tristana has a strong laning phase and a good peel / escape mechanism, making it hard to gank 
        she does good damage both in early and late game 
        she's also very bursty 
        she also has cooldown resets that make her strong in teamfights 

        she can get a little outscaled by other ADCs, but it's not bad 
        also her escape can be interrupted 

    varus has very strong long range poke, so he's a strong laning champion. he has good long range engage too 
        he's also very bursty 
        he has good waveclear too 
        his abilites are also decent in team fights (ult, passive, AOE damage)

        but he lacks mobility and is squishy, so if he's far forward he's vulnerable to gank 
            also he can have a hard time against bruisers with good engages, especially if they have CC 
            he likes to stay at range 
        he's also skillshot reliant so struggles against high mobility champions 

    vayne is a very strong hypercarry 
        she's also a great duelist 
        and she's a tank shredder since she does true damage 

        her early game laning is weaker because of her range 
        also she's reliant on her CC hitting the enemy into terrain 

        watch for her rolling > trying to knock you into terrain 

    xayah (the bird lady) scales very well and deals alot of damage 
        she also has an AOE CC (though it can be hard to hit consistently) 
        she's also hard to kill (not especially vulnerable to ganks) 

        she can struggle against lane bullies, she's more of a scaling champ 

    miss fortune has good poke and is a lane bully 
        she also has good move speed, so it can be hard to catch her (her passive gives bonus movement out of combat)  
        she's very strong in teamfights as well 

        she requires alot of mana early game
        if you can CC her so that she can't run she's quite squishy and has no dash to escape 

        full engage lane bullies are good against her since she prefers to poke 

    Zeri is good at kiting and has good range 
        in lane she does well against scaling caries who she can outrange and bully, but not as well against lane bullies 
        she becomes very good at teamfighting 

        but she's weaker in the early game, and she needs a support who can peel for her 
            so she's probably fairly gankable early on 

    --------------------------------------------------------
    WORKING WITH ALLIED SUPPORTS
    -------------------------------------------------------- 

    supports that have CC are better for early engages, and remain useful in teamfights even if they die alot 

    pantheon support is always a very aggressive support pick, apparently 

    sona is a scaling support champ. you generally don't all out engage early with them, you instead prefer to poke and leverage her heals
    
    likewise with soraka you generally want to trade periodically to take advantage of her heals

    janna has good disengage abilities which helps ADCs that are slow or immobile 


--------------------------------------------------------
THE FUNDAMENTALS OF MID LANE 
-------------------------------------------------------- 

mid laners are usually one of 2 types of champions (though not always): 
    1) mage 
    2) melee assassin 

    trading with mages usually is based around their abilities, often skillshots 

    many melee assassins are weak until level 3 since their kits often rely on the synergy between abilities 
        so they often have to play passive before level 3, often losing CS. 
        if they try to last hit but don't have any followup they can just get damaged for free

        but after level 3 it often becomes alot harder for the mage, and the melee assassin can trade well with them 


    mid is the most vulnerable to ganks of any lane 
        but placing a ward at the entrance to the river is a very good way to be safe 
        hug the side where you placed that ward and you should be pretty safe 
    
    the value of an earlier wave is alot higher than it is later in the game 
        this is because you level up very quickly early in the game 

    before roaming make you've pushed the wave into the tower 

    likewise, you can deny your opponent the opportunity to roam by pushing your wave more aggressively 

    note that by crashing a wave into a tower you apply pressure to the enemy 

    once it reaches the middle game you can also switch to a side lane and catch waves 
    
    mages are usually very weak in 1v1s 
        so usually you should be leary of pushing past the neutral zone as a mage 
        they're also usually not very good at pushing side lanes for this reason 
    
    melee assassins are more mobile, so often can push further and apply pressure better 
        if your assasin is very mobile (talon / nocturne) you may be able to respond to a far away fight with a flank 
        when you flank you often get to do cleanup and get a good angle on the enemy backline 

    when pushing a wave it can often be good to push it into tower, but not walk up to the tower and instead stay back 
        this will prevent you from dying to ganks 
        this is more applicable if you don't know where the jungler is, if you can't retreat easily, etc. 
        it's also a good time for you to go place wards 

    after pushing a sideline into tower you usually have 3 options: 
        1) rejoin your team elsewhere (diverting enemy resources to the wave) 
        2) wait in the enemy jungle for someone to rotate and pick them off 
        3) walk up the tower and damage it  

    but note that someone should be pushing midlane, this gives alot of map control. 
        if your ADC just isn't pushing midlane you'll have to focus on midlane 
    

--------------------------------------------------------
SMURF COMENTARIES - MID LANERS
-------------------------------------------------------- 

    ahri is very mobile with her ultimate 
        she's really an assassin / mage hybrid 
        she has very good wave clear 
        but she's weak early game 
        she usually doesnt start roaming until later, at least after she gets her ult 
            but her roaming is very powerful 
        she's also good at creating picks since she can dash and out 
        she should be played for CS like a scaling champion
            she gets quite weak if she's behind 

        she's very skillshot and ult reliant 

        she might be somewhat gankable pre-6 / without oher ult, but her charm is still a good defensive spell 
            she doesn't seem that gankable otherwise 

        if she's on your team her charm does help during ganks, and her mobility should allow her to engage assuming she's lvl 6


    akali has tons of mobility with her long shuriken dash, her ult which is a long double dash, and a passive which gives an MS bonus on hit 
        she's a very safe laner - hard to gank 
        she's looking to snowball
            and yet she's weaker early game, she comes online in the early-mid game 
            she needs levels to really start dealing damage
        she's all burst damage, doesn't have much sustained damage 

        she does well against scaling midlaners, 
            and struggles against lane bullies who can bully her before she's high enough level to do good damage

        if she's on your team her mobility will help her to engage with you during a gank 


    akshan is good laner and very strong early, he functions as a lane bully
        though he can still struggle in lane if he's outranged
        he has good waveclear with his boomerang though 
        he has very high mobility with his rope swing, though note that this can be interrupted / requires a good wall nearby 
            he can also escape well with it, so he's not that gankable unless he's not near a place he can hook to easily 
        he's one of the best roamers in the game too, with his invisibility he can bypass wards
        he scales into more of an assassin than a typical ranged 
        he doesn't do a ton in teamfights, so in lane you mostly have to sit back and outscale him 

        if he's on your team his mobility should help him engage with you during a gank 


    anivia is usually a counter pick. she's generally good against short range / melee and dive champs, 
        and quite bad against enemies that outrange her. they can just poke her out 
        but she's generally known for having a safe laning phase compared to most other mages 
        so this probably makes her somewhat difficult to gank, especially under tower, 
            but her mobility is low so if she's far forward it might be ok 

        she usually plays the early game quite slowly. 
            once she gets lvl 6 she can put her ult on the wave and roams continuously. she then mainly focuses on roaming 
        in lane she can trade with the enemy and use her egg to recover her health as long as they don't have the damage to kill the egg 

        note that she has alot of slow and CC, and scales quite well into the late game 
            she's good in both team fights and bursting down single targets - she generally goes electrocute for additional burst 

        her main weaknesses are lack of mobility and she's skillshot reliant 

        if she's on your team her CC will help during a gank, but she'll need to be in range or initiate to participate 
            

    annie has alot of burst, and if she has her ult she can just instantly kill squishier enemies 
        she's also known as being very easy to play at low elo 
        she's very good at farming, last-hitting with her Q fireball (refunds mana if kills the minion) and wave clearing with her cone AOE 
        her ult is thought to be one of the strongest in the game, too - tons of AOE damage on cast then tibbers itself to deal with
        she's very good at teamfights since she has a ton of AOE and bursts people down quickly, plus tibbers survives if she dies 
            if her passive is up (every 4th attack stuns) and she uses her cone AOE it'll stune all enemies in a cone 
            also note that tibbers becomes enraged when annie dies, gaining tons of attack speed and movement speed 

        her weakness is she has short range, and has to get close to burst down enemies
            and she isn't good at killing tankier enemies, since she can't burst them down 

        she's probably fairly gankable as long as you can 2v1 her, or you know she can't burst you down,
            like after she's used an ability or if you know her ult is down / she's not lvl 6 yet

        if she's on your team she'll need to be in range or initiate during the gank, but her high burst should help ensure the kill 


    aurelion sol has alot of consistent damage (not bursty) 
        he scales very well into the late game 
        he has very interesting pathing with his flight ability, he can move over terrain while using Q (breathing his fire) 
        he's very strong in teamfights with alot of AOE and damage 

        but he has a very weak early game 
        his flight can also be interrupted with CC 

        so because he's weak early he would be gankable, but he has his flight ability.
            so I think he's gankable if you or the laner has CC (which interrupts his flight), but otherwise it isn't clear. 
            but at least I don't think he's likely to kill you during a gank 
            and if you wanted to ignore him and focus another lane it's at least likely your laner won't die to him early 

        if he's on your team his flight ability should help him engage during the gank, 
            where he can provide some consistent damage but not much CC (unless he has ult)
