    enemy jungler           1st counter pick    2nd counter pick    3rd counter pick    my additional picks 

    Amumu                   rammus
        not sure, maybe rammus's early ganks are strong when amumu is just farming and can't do much to prevent them 
        also it's nice having a tank against a tank late game, you can keep amumu off your team and prevent the AOE damage maybe

    Bel’Veth                trundle 
        Trundle makes sense - a strong dueler can get to Bel'Veth early, and can contest objectives 

    Brand                   rammus 
        I bet rammus can countergank / chase down Brand very well. Brand is very slow and probably can't escape
        also brand doesn't seem very good at ganks in the early phases which would be needed to counter rammus  

    Darius                  wukong 
        I think wukong makes sense... he can attack darius with abilities then leave, avoiding hemorrhage stacks

    Diana                   qiyana

    Dr Mundo                qiyana 

    Ekko                    elise 
        maybe he's fragile early and elise can chase him down well, not sure 

    Elise                   kayn 

    Evelynn                 sejuani 
        probably CC in a fight situation just locks her down and she blows up 
        also I expect it's hard for her to fight against sejuani since sejuani is so tanky, but she preferes to burst down targets 

    Fiddlesticks            poppy 
        stuns against fiddle seem like a good strategy, if you can stunlock him he can't survive to cast his abilities 
        also you can knock him out of teamfights, which could be a very good counter to his ultimate  

    Gragas                  shyvana 
        probably you just farm and outscale him here.
        he's a poke and utility champion but you have a strong engage 
        not sure why else 

    Graves                  kayn 

    Gwen                    ivern 

    Hecarim                 kayn                sejuani             shyvana
    
    Ivern                   sejuani 

    Jax                     taliyah             sejuani             elise               poppy destroys jax 
        taliyah does make sense because she's AP and ranged. she can also block Jax out of the game, and prevent him from jumping.
        maybe Sejuanis CC is another good way of dealing with him 
        and maybe Elise can just snowball the game before he gets strong, he's weak early 
        I also like poppy because her W prevents jax from jumping on her, and she can also knox Jax out of the game 

    Jarvan IV               taliyah

    Karthus                 wukong 
        if you can surprise and get on top of karthus i bet he has a hard time landing his Q and dies very quickly 
    
    Kayn                    qiyana              

    Kha’Zix                 kayn                trundle             kindred

    Kindred                 sejuani             taliyah             wukong
        CC seems to be a strong counter against kindred, and a good frontline to absorb her damage
        not sure why taliyah is good, maybe again the CC and ability to focus fire and outrange kindred
        wukong probably because he can get right on top of kindred and escape with his W 

    Lee Sin                 wukong              sejuani             talon

    Lillia                  kindred                                 I think rammus is good at chasing her too
