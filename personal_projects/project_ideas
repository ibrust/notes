projects:
Python - calculator of some sort. Use tkinter or some other UI framework.
2nd python project - some kind of educational GIS game… example was map you point & click on, trying to match country names. 
What else could you do with GIS using python?
What about finding a location…? An app for finding a location.
what about a Flask or Django app that implements the map with Javascript? Could also use tkinter's map...

iOS - fitness app that tracks your workout routine or something… and also uses iOS’s new health frameworks 

Javascript - some way of choosing HTML, CSS, and maybe Bootstrap / other design framework code...
an app that could do this dynamically, generating samples…
