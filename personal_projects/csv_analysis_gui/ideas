what should this program do?

- it should use numpy to do some sort of analysis probably

- i want to be able to choose a random location in the united states

- i want to be able to filter the set that I'm choosing from based on a variety of criteria
    I'm not sure how this feature should work
    should there be a window where I enter a field, or something like a SQL expression? kinda like arc's SQL builder

    you'll get the data from a CSV file
    so you could also just populate a table with the fields and detect the type of data it is
        then have some reasonable input or search box show up based on the data type
    these may be things you can do with numpy
