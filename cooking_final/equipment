PANS 
=====================================

the safest options are: 

    1) stainless steel pans 
        ideal for acidic foods or high heat     
            best for: 
                all-purpose cooking 
                pan sauces 
                simmering acidic ingredients like tomato sauce 

        no chemical coating, very versatile 
        lower quality pans may contain trace amount of nickel. the amounts are very low but still try to avoid 

        brands to look at are All-Clad, Tramontina, Made In 

    2) carbon steel pans 
        ideal for high heat cooking of non-acidic foods
            best for: 
                searing 
                stir frying 
                other high-heat foods benefiting from non stick surfaces 
            pros compared to stainless steel: 
                they can develop a natural non-stick surface 
                they sear better 
                can be used on a wide variety of heat sources, including open flames / grills 
            cons compared to stainless steel: 
                they can react with acidic foods
                they require seasoning and hands-on care 
                heat distribution can be less even than a stainless steel pan which has multiple layers to distribute heat 
                fond is harder to develop in sauces 
                    (fond is the flavorful brown layer developed from things sticking to the bottom of the pan) 
        similar to cast iron but they respond to temperature changes more quickly, and iron won't leech into the food  

        brands to look at are Made In, Merten & Storck and Oxo
