thyme / sunflower / lavendar / heather honey all look good. 
    lavendar seems good in tea. 
    thyme may be good on ham 
    heather honey is just good all around it seems. 
    sunflower is more of a substantial wax honey and could add some honey kick in baking apparently 


clover honey is most recommended for health benefits. 

In all cases for honey make sure it contains no glyphosate (bees can aggregate glyphosate from nearby crops)

    on that note, this white honey looks promising:
