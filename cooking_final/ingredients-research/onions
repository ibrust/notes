========================================
TYPE OF ONION 
========================================

the amount of sugar, and the concentration of sulfur compounds, are what distinguish the taste of different onion types. 

- sweet onions - the most mild. low in sulfur 
- white onions - balanced and cleaner in aroma, less lingering sulfer 
- yellow onions - still sulphurous, but typically milder than red 
- red onions - often the sharpest and most sulphurous 
- shallots - the most intense of all 


========================================
CHEMICAL CHANGES DURING COOKING 
========================================     

The four main chemical changes to understand during cooking are: 

1) sulfer compound evolution 
    as onions cook the sulfer molecules break down and become sweeter, more savory compounds 

2) maillard reaction
    it's a reaction involving both amino acids and sugar 
    occurs when you're sauteeing or caramelizing onions. 
    typically will happen when pan is from 285F-330F. 
    give a deep roasted, savory flavor 

3) caramelization 
    it's a reaction only involving the sugars. the sugars themselves start to break down. 
    occurs between 320-355F 
    mainly seen in deeply cooked onions where nearly all the water is gone, and the reaction has time to occur. 
    you must be careful not to raise the temperature too high or the sugars will just burn 

4) pyrolysis 
    when the onions are exposed to high heat without moisture it chars. 
    has a smoked, bitter, acrid flavor. Should be used carefully and minimally. 

========================================
WAYS ONION CAN BE PREPARED 
========================================        

1) raw 
    onions are described as pungent. 
        pungency is a mild physical irritation that registers as slightly spicy, bitter, or overly aromatic. 
        usually pugency is caused by sulphurous compounds. 
        other examples of pungent foods are wasabi, horseradish. 

    When an onion is cut, volatile sulphurous compounds are produced by an enzyme reaction. 
        The finer you cut the onion the more of these compounds will be produced. 
        These compounds are responsible for its pungency. You can smell it, and it'll make your eyes water. 

    But these comounds degrade over time. 
        So if you wait (from 10-60 minutes) after cutting the onion... its pungency is reduced. 
        And if you cut an onion small, and wait some time, its pungency is more reduced.
    
    Hence color, cut size, and wait time are the critical factors to consider when using raw onions 

    A larger onion size will also make the onions taste stand out more, while a smaller size will make it blend in

2) pickled 
    Pickling will make the onion taste more sour, and no longer pungent or sharp. 
    The volatile compounds are reduced.
    They also won't be as crunchy since the pickling process will break them down some.  
    
3) sweated 
    The onions cell walls are will break down through the cooking process. 
    Here the onions turn translucent as cell walls collapse and release moisture. 
    But we are not getting a maillard reaction. 
    So the onion will be mellower (due to the sulfur compounds breaking down), 
        but there won't be the roasted savory flavor of the maillard reaction. 

4) sauteed 
    Here the higher heat cuauses more rapid water loss. 
    the internal pressure from steam builds until some cells burst and dry out, causing browning.
    In sauteeing we get a maillard reaction. 
    Like sweated onions the onions pungency is reduced, but in addition it will have a roasted savory flavor. 

5) caramelized 
    When you add onions to a pan the water will start to evaporate. They're about 90% water. 
        This concentrates the flavor compounds, including the natural sugars in the onion. 
        This is the main reason caramelized onions taste sweet.  
    Cell walls will be almost completely broken down. 
        usually after 45, 60, or 90 minutes of low moist heat the pectin network fully dissolves. 
        onions will have a jammy texture. 
    Here we have both maillard reactions and caramelization. 
        The caramelization adds a buttery, toffee, sweet flavor. 

6) charred 
    onion is exposed to high heat, causing pyrolysis. 
    This gives a smoky, bitter, acrid flavor. 
    Charred onions will get a maillard but not a caramelization reaction.
