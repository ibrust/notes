COMPOSITION
===============================================================================================

~98% of olive oil is fatty acids (triglycerides).
    Oleic acid will make up 55%-83% of the lipids.
        Oleic acid has a single double bond in its carbon chain, making it very stable. 
        This makes it different than polyunsaturated fats (PUFAs) found in high concentrations in sunflower, corn, and soybean oils. 
            PUFAs have multiple double bonds and are highly reactive to oxygen. 
            Oleic acid resists oxidation. 
    Polyunsaturated Fats (Linoleic and Linolenic Acid) make up ~3%-21% of the lipids. 
        High-quality EVOO is favored for cooking precisely because its low PUFA content minimizes the risk of thermal degradation. 
        When an oil is described as fragile, it often contains a higher percentage of PUFAs.
    Saturated Fats (Palmitic and Stearic Acid) make up ~8%-~24% of the lipids. 
        These are also extremely stable under heat

~2% of olive oil consists of vitamins (Vitamin E or alpha-tocopherol), pigments (chlorophyll and carotenoids), and polyphenols.

Polyphenols are responsible for the bitterness and pungency (the peppery taste) in high-quality oil. 
    Specific compounds like oleocanthal produce a stinging sensation. 
    A bland oil is almost invariably a low-polyphenol oil. 

When EVOO is heated, polyphneol antioxidants neutralize free radicals, delaying the oxidation of the fat. 
    This is why an unrefined, polyphenol-rich EVOO is safer to cook with than a refined oil with a higher smoke point. 
    The refined oil has been stripped of its antioxidants and has no defense against degradation once heat is applied

The aroma of olive oil (fresh cut grass, tomato leaf) is derived from volatile organic compounds (VOCs) 
    generated by enzymes (lipoxygenase pathway) when the olive is crushed. 
    These compounds are fleeting. They evaporate over time and are destroyed by heat. 

    The delicate volatile aromas are best preserved by using the oil as a raw finishing ingredient.

===============================================================================================
TYPES OF OLIVE OIL
===============================================================================================

Extra Virgin Olive Oil 
    It must be extracted by mechanical means (centrifugation or pressing) at temperatures below 27°C (80.6°F), 
        a process known as "cold extraction." No chemicals or heat treatments are permitted.

    EVOO is the most versatile oil. Its high antioxidant content makes it stable for cooking, 
        while its complex flavor makes it ideal for finishing.

Virgin Olive Oil
    rarely seen on American retail shelves but is common in production countries. 
    It is also mechanically extracted but has lower standards than EVOO.

Lampante Virgin Olive Oil
    Virgin oil with severe defects (median defects > 6.0) or high acidity (> 2.0%) is classified as Lampante (lamp oil). 
    It is unfit for human consumption in its raw state and must be sent to a refinery.

Refined Olive Oil
    When Lampante oil is processed industrially (using steam, heat, and bleaching clays) it becomes Refined Olive Oil. 
    This removes the acidity and the offensive flavors, but it also strips away the polyphenols, vitamins, and volatile aromatics.

"Pure" Olive Oil / Olive Oil 
    This is a marketing term for a blend of Refined Olive Oil and a small quantity (5-15%) of Virgin or Extra Virgin oil 
        added to restore a modicum of color and flavor.
    A pragmatic choice for high-volume frying or baking where a neutral flavor is desired, 
        but it offers minimal health benefits compared to EVOO.

Olive Pomace Oil
    After the olives are pressed, a wet paste of skins, pits, and pulp remains (the pomace). 
    This waste product still contains residual oil, which is extracted using chemical solvents (like hexane) and high heat.

    It must be refined and then blended with virgin oil to be edible.
    Pomace oil is the cheapest grade. 
    It has a high smoke point (~460°F) and is widely used in industrial food service for deep frying.


===============================================================================================
COOKING WITH HEATED EVOO IS SAFER
===============================================================================================

It is a persistent myth that EVOO has a low smoke point and becomes toxic when heated. 
    This belief, while widely repeated, is contradicted by modern food science.

The "smoke point" is the temperature at which an oil begins to produce continuous visible bluish smoke. 
    For high-quality EVOO, the smoke point is typically between 375F and 410F.

However, the smoke point is a poor indicator of an oil's suitability for cooking. 
    The more critical metric is Oxidative Stability, which is the oil's resistance to breaking down into harmful compounds 
    (polar compounds, lipid peroxides, and aldehydes) under heat.

Research comparing the performance of various oils (EVOO, virgin, canola, sunflower, grapeseed) in deep-frying conditions has yielded counterintuitive results. Despite having higher smoke points, many refined seed oils degrade faster than EVOO.
The high polyphenol content in EVOO acts as a buffer. When heat is applied, the antioxidants consume the free radicals generated by the thermal stress. They essentially "take the bullet" for the fatty acids, preserving the integrity of the oil.

The high monounsaturated fat (oleic acid) content of EVOO is chemically stable. 
Seed oils high in polyunsaturated fats (like grapeseed or sunflower) are chemically fragile.
    Their multiple double bonds are easily cleaved by heat, leading to rapid accumulation of toxic polar compounds.

Studies have demonstrated that EVOO produces the lowest quantity of harmful polar compounds when heated, 
    outperforming oils with significantly higher smoke points.

You Can Fry in EVOO. Deep frying in EVOO is not only possible but healthier. 
    It produces a crust that is rich in flavor and antioxidants. The limiting factor is usually cost, not chemistry.

    While EVOO is stable, the antioxidants are depleted during the first heating cycle. 
        Reusing olive oil for multiple frying sessions significantly reduces its stability and increases the polar compounds. 
        If you fry with EVOO, filter it carefully, but it is best used only once or twice.

If you accidentally overheat the pan and see a wisp of smoke, the oil is not instantly toxic. Remove it from the heat. 

If the cost of deep frying in EVOO is prohibitive, "Pure Olive Oil" or "Olive Pomace Oil" are acceptable alternatives. 
    They offer the stable high-oleic fatty acids without the expensive polyphenols (which will be degraded by high heat anyway). 
    Pomace oil is the standard for Mediterranean street food frying due to its high smoke point (460°F) and low cost.

EVOO VARIETIES & USES
===============================================================================================

mild & delicate EVOO oils:
    These have sweet, buttery, and floral flavors. 
    They have low bitterness and pungency.

    - Arbequina (Spain, California) 
        It is sweet and nutty, with aromas of green apple, banana, and almond. 
        It lacks the aggressive bite of robust oils.
        It's the primary variety for Super-High-Density (SHD) mechanical harvesting in California and Spain. 
            This availability means it is often fresher and more affordable than rarer varieties
    
    - Taggiasca (Liguria, Italy)
        Exceptionally delicate, with hints of sweet almond and herbs. 
        The traditional oil for Pesto Genovese - its mildness ensures it doesn't overpower the basil and pine nuts.

    - Leccino  (Central Italy)
        Often found in Tuscan blends to temper the spiciness of other varities. 
        On its own it is mild, with hints of valerian, herbs, and a sweet finish.

    Best Uses: 
        Baking (replacing butter in cakes)
        mayonnaise
        pesto
        delicate white fish
        finishing mild soups
        drizzling on soft cheeses (fresh mozzarella)

medium intensity EVOO oils: 
    These are versatile oils with a balance of fruitiness, bitterness, and pungency. 

    - Koroneiki (Greece)
        The defining flavor of Greek cuisine.
        Smells of fresh-cut grass, green herbs, and green apple skin. 
        It has a "zingy" peppery finish but is not overwhelmingly bitter. 
        Koroneiki olives are very small and difficult to harvest, but they yield oil with very high stability and polyphenol content.

    - Hojiblanca (Spain)
        Complex and vegetal, with hints of wild flowers and artichoke.
        Has a persistent but pleasant peppery aftertaste. 
        It is superb for finishing gazpacho or dipping bread.

    - Nocellara del Belice (Sicily, Italy)
        feels creamy in the mouth, with a distinct aroma of tomato leaf and green tomato. 
        It is fruity and savory.

    Best Uses: 
        Salad dressings
        roasting vegetables
        pasta sauces
        marinades
        daily sautéing


robust and pungent EVOO oils: 
    These are "Finishing Oils" in the truest sense. 
    High in polyphenols, they are bitter, spicy, and intense.

    - Picual (Andalusia, Spain)
        The most planted olive in the world. 
        It is a powerhouse of stability. 
        Flavors include tomato vine, fig leaf, and green wood. 
        It has a medium-to-strong bitterness.

        Picual is the absolute best choice for high-heat cooking due to its extreme resistance to oxidation, 
            though its robust flavor means it is also excellent for finishing.
    
    - Coratina (Puglia, Italy)
        One of the highest polyphenol oils available. 
        It can be aggressively bitter and pungent, often described as "green almond" and "spicy rocket."
        It delivers a serious cough-inducing kick.
        big, bold, and tannic.
    
    - Frantoio (Tuscany, Italy)
        The backbone of the famous Tuscan blends. 
        Has an intense aroma of artichoke, green almond, and a distinct black pepper finish. 
        The "Tuscan burn" is a prized attribute of this varietal.

    Best Uses: 
        Grilling red meat (the tannins cut through the fat)
        drizzling over hearty stews (ribollita)
        bitter greens (kale, arugula)
        aged hard cheeses
        bruschetta
        
    Note: Do not use for mayonnaise (it will taste metallic and bitter)

STORAGE
===============================================================================================

The three enemies of olive oil are Heat, Light, and Air.

    1) Light: 
        Photons trigger photo-oxidation, destroying flavor and antioxidants. 
        Never buy premium oil in clear glass bottles unless they are boxed. 
        Store in dark glass or tin.

    2) Heat: 
        Store in a cool, dark cupboard (55-70F). 
        Do not store next to the stove or on top of the refrigerator. 
        Prolonged heat accelerates rancidity.

    3) Air: 
        Oxygen causes oxidation. 
        Keep the cap tight. 
        Once a bottle is opened, the clock ticks faster. 
        Use opened bottles within 2-3 months. 
        Do not "save" a special bottle for too long - it will go bad.
