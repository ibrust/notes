WHEAT FLOUR OVERVIEW 
================================================================================

wheat flour is made by grinding wheat kernels, which consist of three parts: 
    1) bran - the outer layer, rich in fiber and nutrients 
    2) germ - the nutrient-rich core, containing fats and vitamins 
    3) endosperm - the starchy middle, mostly carbs and some protein 
the proportions of these parts affects color, flavor, nutrition, and baking properties 


FLOUR TYPE          PROTEIN %       BEST FOR 
cake flour          6-8%            light cakes, tender pastries 
pastry flour        8-9%            pie crusts, muffins 
all-purpose flour   10-12%          pancakes, cookies, general baking 
bread flour         12-14%          yeast breads, pizza dough 
whole wheat flour   13-14%          hearty breads, rustic baking 


gluten is formed when flour is mixed with water and kneaded.
    It gives dough elasticity and structure 

higher protein = more gluten = chewier texture 
lower protein = less gluten = tender texture 

understanding how flour behaves helps you choose or blend flours: 
    high protein flours:
        absorb more water
        trap gas better, aiding in yeast-leavened breads 
    low protein flours: 
        allow cookies and pancakes to spread more 
        yield softer textures, ideal for cakes and pastries 

bleached flour: treated with chemicals to whiten and soften. good for cakes and cookies 
unbleached flour: naturally aged, slightly denser, better for bread and pizza 

some specialty flours worth noting: 
    white whole wheat - milder flavor, good for healthier baking 
    high-gluten flour: even more protein than bread flour, used for bagens and chewy breads 
    self-rising flour: all-purpose flour with baking powder and salt added 

on a flour label look for: 
    protein % 
    type of wheat (hard vs soft) 
    milling method 
    enrichment or bleaching 
    organic or conventional 

================================================================================
LEAVENING
================================================================================

Leavening means introducing gas (usually CO2) into a dough or batter to make it rise and become light and airy. 
    this process creates pockets of air that expand during baking, giving baked goods their characteristic texture
    whether it be the fluffiness of pancakes or chewiness of bread 

wheat flour consists of gluten-forming proteins (glutenin and gliadin). when mixed with water and kneaded or stirred, 
    these proteins form gluten, a stretchy network that traps gas bubbles. Leavening agents produce gas, 
    and gluten holds it in place, allowing the dough or batter to expand. 

here's how the main leavening agents interact with flour: 

    1) yeast: 
        biological leavener. 
        it consumes sugars and produces CO2 / alcohol through fermentation. 
        it's best for breads or pizza dough. 
        it requires proofing (rising time) to allow fermentation 
        it needs a strong gluten (high-protein flour) to trap gas and create structure 
    2) baking powder: 
        chemical leavener. 
        it contains both an acid and a base (usually baking soda + cream of tartar). 
        it reacts with moisture and heat to release CO2. 
            most baking powders are double-acting. 
            they release gas in two stages - when they encounter water, and when they encounter heat. 
        best for pancakes, muffins, quick breads, cakes
        it acts quickly - bake immediately after mixing 
        it works well with medium or low protein flours for tender textures 
    3) baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) 
        chemical leavener.
        needs an acid (buttermilk, yogurt, lemon juice, venegar) to activate and release CO2. 
    4) eggs 
        mechanical and structural leavener 
        beaten eggs trap air. during baking the air expands and proteins coagulate, helping structure and rise 
        best for cakes, souffles, pancakes, some breads 
        eggs add richness and help bind ingredients. they compliment gluten structure and can add leavening when whipped
    5) steam 
        in pastries like puff pastry or chous, water turns to steam and expands, puffing up the dough 
    6) air incorporation 
        creaming butter and sugar can work like eggs, where you introduce air which expands during baking 

common leavening approaches for different bread types: 
    pancakes        8-10% protein (pastry / AP blend )          baking powder, eggs             tender, fluffy texture 
    bread           12-14% protein (bread flour)                yeast                           strong gluten needed 
    cake            6-8% protein (cake flour)                   baking powder / soda, eggs      soft, delicate crumb 
    cookies         9-11% protein (AP flour)                    baking soda / powder            depends on desired texture 
    muffins         8-10% protein                               baking powder/soda, eggs        moist, tender crumb

KEY ASPECTS OF FLOUR TO UNDERSTAND
================================================================================
    1) protein content:
        defines gluten potential, which effects structure and chewiness 
        low protein (6-9%): tender baked goods (cakes, pancakes, pastries)
        medium protein (10-12%): versatile (all-purpose flour) 
        high protein (12-14%): strong gluten network (bread, pizza dough)
    2) gluten quality 
        it is not just quantity of gluten, the type of gluten proteins matters (gliadin and glutenin)
            the type effects elasticity, extensibility, and gas retention in dough 
    3) ash content 
        indicates mineral content of the bran 
        higher ash = more flavor and color, but can effect gluten development 
        lower ash = whiter flour, milder flavor (common in pastry and cake flours) 
    4) extraction rate 
        percentage of the whole grain used 
        high extraction (e.g., whole wheat): more bran and germ, more nutrients, denser texture 
        low extraction (e.g. white flour): finer texture, less flavor complexity 
    5) milling type 
        stone-milled: retains more nutrients and flavor, can be coarser 
        roller-milled: more consistent texture, common in commercial flours 
    6) enrichment & additives 
        some flours are enriched with vitamins or treated with bleaching agents 
        bleached flour: softer texture, faster aging 
        unbleached flour: slightly firmer, more natural flavor 
    7) moisture content: 
        affects shelf life and hydration behavior 
        lower moisture = longer shelf life 
    8) flavor profile 
        whole wheat and high ash flours have nutty, earthy flavors 
        refined flours are neutral, allowing other ingredients to shine 

================================================================================
BLENDING FLOURS 
================================================================================

chefs often blend flours to fine-tune: 
    - texture: combine high and low protein flours to balance tenderness and structure 
    - flavor: add whole wheat or rye for depth 
    - color: use high-ash flours for darker crusts or rustic appearance 

example blends: 
    pancakes: 50% all-purpose + 50% pastry flour => 9-10% protein 
    rustic bread: 70% bread flour + 30% whole wheat => chewy with nutty flavor 
    cookies: 80% all-purpose + 20% cake flour => tender but holds shape 

some people will add in small amounts of cornstarch too, to reduce gluten formation, results in a softer texture 
and you can also add vital wheat gluten to boost protein if needed, i.e. for bread

ITALIAN WHEAT FLOURS 
================================================================================

for italian flour AI has recommended a few brands: 
    antimo caputo, molino grassi, polselli, mulino quaglia (petra) 

molino grassi has different types of 00 flour that are distinguished by their intended use (i.e. pizza, pasta, all-purpose), 
    which corresponds with variations in their protein content, gluten strength, 
    and whether they are made from soft wheat or durum wheat 

the italian wheat classification system is tipo 00, 0, 1, 2, or integrale. 
it refers to how finely the flour is milled and how much of the wheat grain is retained. 
these types are regulated by italian law and are based on ash content, which is a proxy for how much bran and germ remain 

            protein %       ash content %   texture         grain components 
tipo 00     ~8-9%           ~0.55%          very fine       mostly endosperm 
tipo 0      ~10-11%         ~0.65-0.70%     fine            mostly endosperm 
tipo 1      ~11-12%         ~0.80-0.85%     medium-course   some bran & germ 
tipo 2      ~12-13%         ~0.95-1.10%     course          more bran & germ 
integrale   ~13-14%         >1.30%          coursest        whole grain 

bear in mind these protein counts are estimates, and I've seen italian flours tipo 00 with 11.7% protein
