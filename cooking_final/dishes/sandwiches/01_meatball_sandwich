MEATBALL SANDWICH - DONE
===================================================

The traditional meatloaf mixture of beef, pork, and veal is the preferred mix for meatballs. 
    Each type of meat makes a unique contribution to the flavor and texture. 
    Beef provides savory depth and structure. 
    Pork introduces a softer fat with a lower melting point, making the meatball juicier. 
    Veal increases tenderness due to its high collagen content, which breaks down into gelatin during cooking. 
        If veal isn't available a viable substitute is mild italian sausage, which also has high amounts of collagen. 

    Beef should be 80/20 ground chuck. 
        Lower fat content will result in a dense, rubbery matrix due to insufficient intramuscular fat 
        to lubricate the protein strands as they contract under heat. 

    Pork fat, which melts at a lower temperature than beef tallow, creates a localized emulsion within the meatball.

    Some chefs include other things, like finely minced pancetta (introduces cured lipids / nitrates which amplify savoriness), 
        or a small amount of chocolate porter beer (provides malty bitterness that cuts through fats). 

    Regardless of the mixture, the goal should be to maintain a 15-25% fat content by weight, 
        to ensure the meatball remains juicy through multiple cooking stages. 


A panade is a starchy liquid mixture (typically bread or breadcrumbs combined with milk, buttermilk, or stock). 
    It serves a structural function. 
    When ground meat is salted and manipulated, myosin (muscle proteins) begin to dissolve and link together,
        creating a light, springy net. Without a panade, this myosin net contracts during cooking, squeezing out moisture,
        resulting in a dry meatball. 
        
        Starch granultes of the panade bread abosrb liquid and swell, physically obstructing the myosin protein strands 
            and preventing them from linking too tightly.
        Furthermore, as the meatball reaches its target temperature, the starches begin to gelatinize, 
            trapping the rendered fat and juices inside the meatball matrix. 

    For the panade, fresh white bread with the crusts removed is preferred to dry breadcrumbs. 
        Dry breadcrumbs tend to absorb moisture from the meat. 
        We want our pre-saturated panade to act as a reservoire of hydration.

    The optimal ratio is ~25% panade to 75% meat. 

    It's important to ensure the panade achieves a pudding-like consistently before incorporating it into the meat. 
        There should be no dry bread chunks to disrupt the texture of the meatball. 


The flavor profile of the meatball is built up through layering of aromatics. 
    Freshly minced garlic is preferred, although some people use garlic powder to ensure a more even distribution 
        without risking having pungent fragments of garlic. 
    Onions can be grated raw directly into the mixture, or sweated in olive oil for a sweeter, more integrated flavor. 

    Whole milk ricotta cheese (~1/2 cup per pound of meat) introduces both air and moisture. 
        This results in a fluffier texture that persists even after the meatball is ground and broiled. 
    Usually ricotta will be paired with parimigiano-reggiano or pecorino romano.
        These provide salt and umami to contrast the sweet ricotta / pork.

    Herbs spices often include flat leaf parsley, dried oregano, ground fennel seed, and nutmeg. 
        Fennel mimics the flavor of italian sausage, bridging the flags of the beef and pork. 
        Nutmeg enhances the dairy flavors of the ricotta and parmesan, adding a warm complexity. 

The marinara sauce will be significantly thicker than typical pasta sauce.
    This ensures the sandwich doesn't become watery and unmanageable. 

    The choice of tomato is critical. 
        San Marzano tomatoes, grown in the volcanic soil of Italy, are preferred.
        They have low acidity and a high sugar content. 
        
    The tomatoes should be hand crushed, or pulsed briefly in a food processor, to maintain a rustic texture. 


    One technique is simmering the tomatoes with a halved onion and a large quantity of unsalted butter (5 tbsp per 28 oz can). 
        As the sauce simmers, the butter clarifies and emulsifies with the tomato juices. 
        This creates a rich sauce that coats the meatballs and provides a natural moisture barrier for the bread. 
        The onion is removed after the simmer, leaving behind its sweetness without hte textural distraction of diced onion pieces. 

        
    Sauce Reduction Time    Quality                         Uses
    20-30 minutes           thin, bright, acidic            light pasta dishes
    45-60 minutes           medium body, balanced           dipping
    1.5-3 hours             thick, concentrated, sweet      meatball subs 


The meatballs will be cooked in a 3 step process.
    
    First, they'll be seared in a 450F oven. 
        This initiates teh Maillard reaction. 
        The resulting crust also ensures the meatball maintains its shape.
    
    Second, they'll be simmered in sauce. This is the braising phase. 
        They shouldn't simmer for hours. 
        Research shows that exceeding 45 minutes can cause the meatballs to become tough and dry, as the muscle fibers over tighten.
        The optimal time is 20-30 minutes. This allows the meatballs to absorb the sauces acidity while the core remains tender. 

    Third, the entire sandwich is broiled or toasted in a high heat oven at ~400F. 
        Here, the sauce, meat, and cheese are fused together. 

The recipe requires an Italian bread roll, or a high quality baguette with a crackly crust. 
    These breads are resilient enough to ensure they don't disintegrate. 

    A common technique is to remove some of the bread from the top portion, ensuring the meatballs don't slide out of the sandwich. 
        This also allows for a higher volume of sauce and cheese to be contained in the sandwich. 

    To prevent sogginess, a moisture barrier should be established. This is achieved in 2 ways: 
        1) the interior of the roll should be toasted with a layer of garlic butter (butter, minced garlic, parsley, and salt). 
        2) a layer of sliced provolone or mozzarella should be put on the bread before the meatballs and sauce are added.

    fennel seed, 1 tsp, ground 
    11 cloves minced garlic
    0.5 tsp ground nutmeg

    1.25 tsp salt
    1/2 tsp red pepper flakes
    1 tsp dried oregano

for the sauce: 
    san marzano tomatoes, two 28 oz cans 
    unsalted butter, 12 tbsp 
    yellow onion, 1 medium, halved 

italian sub rolls or baguettes, ~5 sandwich-sized rolls
provolone, 12 slices, preferably sharp
mozzarella, 8 oz, low moisture 

cremini mushrooms, 16 oz 
banana peppers, 1 cup, sliced rings 
sun-dried tomatoes, 2/3 cup, julienned (oil-packed preferred)


===================================================
PREPARATION 
===================================================

0) grind the chuck roast (if using a whole roast)
    a) trim the hard fat and silverskin 
    b) weigh out 1 lbs of chuck 
    c) grind the chuck in a food processor
    d) put it back in the refridgerator

1) prepare the sauce (start about 2 hours ahead of time) 
    a) hand-crush the tomatoes into a large bowl, ensuring no large whole tomatoes remain. 
    b) in a dutch oven combine the following: 
        i) the tomatoes & their juice 
        ii) a halved yellow onion 
        iii) 8 tbsp (1 stick) unsalted butter 
        iv) a generous pinch of salt 
    c) heat on medium-high until a simmer is reached 
    d) leave the pot uncovered, but reduce the heat to the lowest setting possible
        this allows the water in the tomatoes to evaporate while the butter emulsifies 
    e) leave simmering for ~90 minutes 
    f) remove the onion halves 
    g) whisk the suace into a smooth consistency 


2) prepare the panade (while simmering) 
    a) in a large bowl combine the 2 cups fresh white bread crumbs (crusts removed) with 1/3 cup buttermilk 
    b) let the mixture sit for 15 minutes until the bread has completely absorbed the liquid, forming a thick paste 
    c) in a separate bowl whisk the following: 
        i) 2 large egg yolks 
        ii) 1/2 cup ricotta cheese 
        iii) 1/2 cup parmigiano-reggiano
        iv) 1 tsp fish sauce 
        v) 1.25 tsp salt 
        vi) 1 tsp ground fennel seed
        vii) 0.5 tsp nutmeg 
        viii) 1 tsp dried oregano
    d) vigorously whisk this mixture into the panade

3) create the meatballs 
    a) put rubber gloves on and rinse hands in cold water periodically.
        this prevents melting the fat in the meat as it's being handled.
    b) take the meats out of the fridge
    c) put the meats in a large bowl (1 lbs ground beef, 0.5 lbs pork, 0.5 lbs veil)
    d) add the following to the meats: 
        i) the chilled ground meats (beef, pork, veil)
        ii) 6 cloves minced garlic (leaving 3 for the garlic butter / 2 for the mushroom saute)
        iii) 1/4 cup minced parsley 
    e) combine the meats and ingredients in the bowl using your hands 
    f) gently incorporate the meat with the panade. 
        stop mixing once you no longer see individual streaks of the panade binder or clumps of one specific meat.
        ensure you don't over-mix the proteins.
    g) shape into 2 inch sphere meatballs (~3oz each, use a reliable scooper to get the amount right)

4) brown the meatballs in the oven (30 minutes before the sauce simmer is done)
    a) line a baking sheet with foil (foil reflects heat, aiding in browning) 
    b) coat the foil itself with oil (facilitates heat transfer and turning) 
    c) cook in a 450F oven for 7-10 minutes, until a brown exterior forms.
        if you have a broiler you could broil on high for 2-3 minutes instead
    d) turn once in the middle of cooking

5) simmer the meatballs (20 minutes before the sauce simmer is done) 
    a) transfer the meatballs into the sauce 
    b) simmer until the meatballs reach 160F, about 20 minutes

6) saute the mushrooms (while simmering the meatballs)
    a) wash the mushrooms in a bowl with cold water 
    b) dry them off with a salad spinner & briefly with paper towels 
    c) slice them evenly 
    d) heat ~3 tbsp ghee in a carbon-steel skillet over high heat 
    e) add the mushrooms in a single layer. 
        do not crowd the pan.
        if necessary, cook in batches to ensure the water evaporates and the mushrooms don't steam 
    f) let the mushrooms sit undisturbed for 5 minutes. 
        This allows the Maillard reaction to occur 
    g) toss the mushrooms and continue cooking for 10-15 minutes until all liquid is evaporated
    h) during the last 60-90 seconds of cooking, add 2 cloves of minced garlic and minced parsley to the mixture 
    i) season with salt at the end. 
        waiting until this stage to add salts prevents the mushrooms from becoming tough

7) prepare the topping 
    a) cut the 2/3 cup sun-dried tomatoes finely enough to eat easily 
    b) dry off 1 cup of banana peppers (to avoid introducing vinegar to the sandwich) 
    c) mix the sun-dried tomatoes, mushrooms, and banana peppers in a bowl and set it aside

8) make the garlic butter
    a) melt 1/2 stick unsalted butter until it begins to foam 
    b) add the 3 cloves remaining minced garlic
    c) saute on medium for 30-45 seconds 
    d) remove from the heat
    e) add a pinch of salt
    f) stir in 2 tbsp finely minced parsley 

9) toast the bread 
    a) spread the garlic butter on both sides of the bread 
    b) cook in the oven at 400F for ~2 minutes
    c) add the sliced provolone to the sandwiches (~2 per sandwich) 
    d) toast for another ~30-60 seconds until the cheese is melted

10) assemble the sandwiches
    a) remove the meatballs and slice them in half (for stability) 
    b) place the meatballs flat-side down onto the melted cheese 
    c) spoon marinara sauce over the meatballs 
    d) sprinkle the shredded mozzarella over the sandwich 
    e) put all the sauce on the sandwiches, including any extra. 
        it will soak into the bread overnight and dry up if there isn't enough.

11) toast the sandwiches at 425F for another 3-5 minutes until the cheese is bubbling, browned in spots, and completely molten
