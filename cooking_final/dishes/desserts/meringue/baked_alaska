Baked Alaska: The Thermal Paradox
The Baked Alaska (also known as Omelette Norvégienne) is a dessert that plays with thermodynamics. It consists of a base (sponge cake), a center of frozen ice cream, and a complete coating of Italian meringue.59
The Science of Insulation
The air trapped in the meringue foam acts as a powerful insulator. This allows the dessert to be placed in a scorching hot oven (500°F/260°C) for several minutes to brown the meringue without melting the ice cream inside.
History: The name was coined at Delmonico's in New York in 1876 to honor the acquisition of Alaska, though the physics were explored earlier by Benjamin Thompson (Count Rumford).59
Taste Profile: The key is the Maillard reaction on the meringue. The browning creates toasted, marshmallow notes that pair beautifully with the cold cream. Modern versions, often called Bombe Alaska, are flambéed with rum or brandy, adding a layer of warm alcohol vapor and bitterness to the sweet profile.
