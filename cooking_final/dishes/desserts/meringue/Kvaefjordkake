Kvæfjordkake: "The World’s Best Cake"
In Norway, Kvæfjordkake holds the title of "Verdens Beste" (The World's Best Cake), a moniker voted on by radio listeners in 2002.37 Originating from Hulda Ottestad's café in Harstad in the 1930s (adapted from a Danish "King Cake"), it has become a national icon.37
The Construction
A classic yellow sponge batter is spread into a baking sheet. A French meringue is spread directly on top of the raw batter, and chopped almonds are sprinkled over the meringue. The entire sheet is baked until the cake is set and the meringue is crisp and golden.
Assembly: The sheet is cut in half. One half is slathered with a mixture of vanilla custard (crème pâtissière) and whipped cream. The second half is placed on top, meringue-side up.
Why It Works: The transition zone where the meringue meets the cake becomes slightly chewy and fused, while the top remains crisp. The custard filling softens the inner meringue face. It is a dessert of comfort—soft, creamy, vanilla-forward, with the almonds providing a toasted crunch. It is less technically demanding than a Marjolaine but arguably just as satisfying.
