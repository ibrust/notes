Île Flottante: The Poached Cloud
Also known as Oeufs à la Neige (Eggs in Snow), the Île Flottante (Floating Island) represents the softest end of the meringue spectrum. Instead of being baked to dryness, the meringue is poached in simmering milk or water.24
The Poaching Technique
Poaching coagulates the egg proteins at a lower temperature (around 160°F-180°F) without evaporating the water content. This results in a meringue that is essentially a stable foam—light, airy, and dissolving instantly on the palate.26
The Assembly: The poached "islands" float in a sea of Crème Anglaise (vanilla custard) made from the yolks left over from the meringue. The dish is finished with a drizzle of caramel or spun sugar.
The Taste Experience: This is a dessert of extreme delicacy. The contrast is not between crisp and soft, but between the cold, viscous richness of the custard and the ethereal, barely-there texture of the meringue. The bitter snap of the caramel garnish provides the only structural resistance. It was a favorite of Julia Child and remains a staple of classic French bistro dining.24
