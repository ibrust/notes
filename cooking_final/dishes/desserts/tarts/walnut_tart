The Walnut Tart (Grenoble/Périgord)
Hailing from the walnut-rich regions of France, the Tarte aux Noix is a study in dry caramelization.
Technique: Unlike an American pecan pie (which uses an egg/corn syrup custard), the French walnut tart often uses a caramel base. Sugar and cream are cooked to a caramel, chopped walnuts are folded in, and the mixture is poured into the shell.47
Flavor: It is intensely nutty, with the bitterness of the walnut skins balancing the sweet caramel. The addition of honey and sea salt is critical to prevent it from becoming cloying.
