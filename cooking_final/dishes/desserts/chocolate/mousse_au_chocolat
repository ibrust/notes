Julia Child’s Mousse au Chocolat (L'Eminence Brune)
The Thesis: The Aeration of Raw Proteins.
Before the modern era of gelatin-stabilized mousses, there was Julia Child’s Mousse au Chocolat, often adapted from her Reine de Saba cake principles.22 This remains the benchmark for "classic" French mousse.
3.4.1 The Role of Raw Eggs
Julia’s recipe relies on the separation of the egg. The yolks are used to emulsify the chocolate and butter, creating a rich base (often flavored with strong coffee or rum). The whites are whipped to stiff peaks with sugar.23 The structure of the mousse comes entirely from the air bubbles trapped in the egg white foam and the setting of the cocoa butter/butter fats upon cooling.
3.4.2 Texture and Mouthfeel
Because it lacks gelatin (which can create a rubbery texture) and whipped cream (which can dilute flavor), this mousse has a "slightly sticky" texture that coats the mouth, delivering a "wallop" of dark chocolate flavor.23 It is intense and concentrated, a "spoon dessert" that feels far more substantial than airy modern versions.
