Pierre Hermé’s Tarte Infiniment Chocolat
The Thesis: The "Rule of Five" and Textural Architecture.
Pierre Hermé, the "Picasso of Pastry," approaches the chocolate tart not as a simple filled shell, but as an architectural construction. His Tarte Infiniment Chocolat (Infinitely Chocolate Tart) is widely considered the greatest iteration of this form.24
4.1.1 The "Infiniment" Philosophy
Hermé’s "Infiniment" series is dedicated to exploring a single flavor through multiple textures. The tart typically consists of five distinct elements:
Pâte Sucrée: A sweet, almond-enriched tart shell. The almond flour reduces gluten formation, creating a "short," sandy texture that crumbles rather than snaps.25
Ganache Onctueuse: A filling made by emulsifying chocolate and cream, then blending in butter at a specific temperature (35-40°C) to create a "perfect emulsion".26
Soft Caramel/Praline Layer: A layer often hidden between the crust and the ganache to provide chew and nuttiness.24
Glaze: A mirror glaze for visual perfection.
Seasoning: The deliberate use of fleur de sel (sea salt) to activate salivary glands and cut richness.
4.1.2 Ingredient Specificity
Hermé is fastidious about sourcing, often specifying Valrhona Guanaja (70%) for bitterness and Araguani (72%) for acidity, or Jivara for milk chocolate versions.25 The result is a dessert that takes the eater on a journey: the crunch of the shell, the chew of the caramel, the melt of the ganache, and the lingering salt finish. It is complex, intellectual, and hedonistic simultaneously.
