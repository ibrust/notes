Chemical and Sensory Analysis
The Grilling Technique: This cake is not baked in a traditional oven setting but grilled (broiled). A small ladle of batter is spread in the pan, grilled from above until caramelized and brown, and then the next layer is applied. This process is repeated 18-20 times.
Maillard Reaction: Because every layer is grilled, the entire cake is essentially "crust." The Maillard reaction (browning) occurs throughout the entire volume of the cake, not just the exterior. This creates a deep, smoky, caramel flavor that penetrates every bite.41
Texture: The texture is dense, firm, and chewy, with a mouthfeel similar to a firm custard or marzipan. It is oily to the touch and incredibly rich. It is a cake of patience and precision, representing a pinnacle of baking technique.
