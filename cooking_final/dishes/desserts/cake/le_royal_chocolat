Le Royal Chocolat (Trianon): The Study in Crunch
Also known simply as "The Royal," this cake is the gold standard for chocolate lovers who crave textural contrast. It is often the first entremets taught in pastry schools to demonstrate the use of feuilletine.32
Architectural Composition
Dacquoise Base: A foundation of almond or hazelnut dacquoise provides a chewy, nutty bottom.32
Croustillant Praliné: This is the defining layer. It is a mixture of hazelnut praline paste, milk chocolate, and pailleté feuilletine (crushed, dried crêpe dentelles). This layer remains crunchy even when frozen or refrigerated because the fat in the praline and chocolate coats the dry crêpes, protecting them from moisture.33
Mousse au Chocolat: A rich, aerated dark chocolate mousse (often pâte à bombe based for richness) forms the body of the cake.
Glaçage Miroir: A dark cocoa mirror glaze finishes the cake, providing a sleek, reflective surface.8
Sensory Analysis and Taste Profile
The eating experience of the Royal is rhythmic: the soft give of the mousse, followed immediately by the audible "crack" and "crunch" of the praline layer.32 The flavor is a classic pairing of dark chocolate and hazelnut. It is rich but varied; the praline adds salt and roast notes, while the mousse delivers the pure cocoa punch.
