Russian Honey Cake (Medovik): The Transformative Biscuit
Origin: Russia (Imperial Court / Soviet Era)
Primary Flavor Profile: Caramelized Honey, Sour Cream, Graham Cracker
Notable Iterations: Michelle Polzine (20th Century Cafe), Smitten Kitchen, Natasha’s Kitchen
The Medovik is a unique entry in the cake pantheon because it begins its life as a cookie. It consists of 8 to 10 layers of honey-based dough, rolled thin and baked into hard, crisp discs. These discs are then layered with a slightly sweetened sour cream (smetana) frosting.7
Chemical and Sensory Analysis
The magic of Medovik is hygroscopy—the absorption of moisture.
The Softening Process: Over a period of 24 to 48 hours in the refrigerator, the moisture from the sour cream migrates into the hard honey biscuits. The biscuits soften, transforming into a cake-like texture. The result is a seamless suspension of cake and cream; one cannot feel the separation between layer and filling on the tongue.7
Flavor Profile: The dominant flavor is burnt honey. Modern recipes, particularly Michelle Polzine’s, emphasize caramelizing the honey deeply before mixing the dough, creating a flavor profile reminiscent of speculoos or gingerbread, but more floral. The sour cream provides a crucial lactic tang that cuts through the intense sweetness of the honey.39
