The Brooklyn Blackout Cake: The Pudding-Filled Legend
Origin: Ebinger’s Bakery, Brooklyn, NY (WWII Era)
Primary Flavor Profile: Dutch Process Cocoa, Chocolate Pudding, Fudge
Notable Iterations: Ovenly, America's Test Kitchen, Ebinger’s Reconstruction
The Brooklyn Blackout is a legendary confection that borders on mythological status. Named after the air-raid blackouts of World War II, the cake was the signature offering of Ebinger’s Bakery until it closed in 1972.18 The original recipe was never officially released, leading to decades of "forensic baking" to recreate it.
Chemical and Sensory Analysis
This is not a standard chocolate layer cake. Its defining characteristic—and the reason for its cult status—is the filling: a starch-thickened chocolate pudding (or pastry cream) rather than a buttercream.
Textural Contrast: The cake layers are soft, usually made with Dutch-process cocoa for a deep, charcoal-like darkness and low acidity. The filling is cool and gelatinous. When eaten, the interplay between the cool pudding and the room-temperature cake creates a "squish" that is unique among cakes.18
The Crumb Coat: The exterior is not merely frosted but spackled with cake crumbs generated from a sacrificed cake layer. This serves a functional purpose: it adheres to the frosting and creates a barrier that prevents the cake from drying out, while also providing a distinct, velvety mouthfeel that contrasts with the smooth pudding.20
The Stout Innovation: Modern iterations, such as the one from Ovenly, introduce chocolate stout beer into the batter. The carbonation aids lift, while the malt notes in the beer amplify the fermented flavors of the cocoa, creating a "black" flavor that is more complex than sugar and chocolate alone.20
Comparative Recipe Insight
Ovenly vs. Traditional: While traditional recipes rely on water or milk, the Ovenly stout addition is widely cited in reviews as producing a deeper, more savory chocolate profile that offsets the sweetness of the pudding.21
Cocoa Selection: Essential to this recipe is Dutch-process cocoa. Natural cocoa (acidic) would react differently with the leaveners and produce a reddish-brown crumb (like Devil's Food). The "Blackout" aesthetic requires the alkaline darkness of Dutch cocoa.
