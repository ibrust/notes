Nougat de Montélimar: The Aerated Honey Paste
Nougat de Montélimar is a Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) confection from Provence, distinguished by its high content of almonds and lavender honey.32
Sensory Profile
A master-class nougat is snowy white, studded with green pistachios and creamy almonds. The texture is chewy but not jaw-breaking, tender but not sticky. It dissolves slowly, releasing the complex floral notes of the honey.
Technical Analysis: Dual Syrup Aeration
The chemistry of nougat is complex, involving the stabilization of an egg white foam with two different sugar syrups:
Honey Syrup: Honey is cooked to a lower temperature (approx. 120°C-130°C) to preserve its volatile aromatics.32
Sugar Syrup: Sugar and glucose are cooked to the hard-crack stage (approx. 145°C-155°C) to provide structural integrity.32
The Process: The honey syrup is poured into whipping egg whites first, followed by the hotter sugar syrup. The heat denatures the albumin, creating a stable foam structure, while the sugars crystallize into a microscopic matrix upon cooling, trapping the air bubbles.34
Master Recipe Considerations
To qualify as true Montélimar style, the recipe must contain at least 30% almonds (or 28% almonds and 2% pistachios) and 25% honey by weight.33 The humidity of the kitchen is a major variable; on humid days, the cook temperature must be increased to compensate for the hydroscopic nature of the honey.
