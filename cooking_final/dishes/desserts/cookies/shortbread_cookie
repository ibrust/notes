The Shortbread: The Ratio of Perfection
Shortbread is an exercise in restraint. The classic Scottish ratio is 1 part sugar, 2 parts butter, 3 parts flour (by weight). However, modern "noteworthy" recipes tweak this ratio for better texture.
7.1 The Butter Imperative
Since butter constitutes the primary flavor carrier, the quality is non-negotiable. European-style cultured butters (e.g., Kerrygold, Plugrá) with higher butterfat (82%+) and lower water content are preferred.35
Salted Butter: Modern palates prefer a savory edge. Recipes from Bon Appétit and King Arthur Baking increasingly call for salted butter to provide a sharp counterpoint to the sugar, preventing the "greasy" mouthfeel sometimes associated with unsalted butter shortbread.35
7.2 Ottolenghi’s "Short" Architecture
Yotam Ottolenghi and Helen Goh have revolutionized the shortbread category by introducing alternative starches.
Rice Flour/Cornstarch: By substituting a portion of the wheat flour with rice flour or cornstarch, the total gluten content is reduced. This makes the cookie "shorter" (more crumbly and sandy). It prevents the "gumminess" that can occur if the dough is overworked.37
Aromatics: Ottolenghi’s recipes are also noteworthy for their infusion of aromatics like orange blossom water, star anise, and coriander directly into the butter.39 This allows the fat to carry the flavor into every crumb of the cookie.
