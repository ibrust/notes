The Alfajor: The South American Sandwich
The Alfajor (specifically the Argentine Maizena style) is defined by its tenderness—it should dissolve on the tongue.
9.1 The Cornstarch Connection
The "noteworthy" aspect of the Alfajor is the flour ratio. Authentic recipes call for anywhere from 50% to 80% cornstarch (corn flour) relative to wheat flour.38
Gluten Absence: The massive quantity of cornstarch ensures that virtually no gluten network can form. This results in a dough that is fragile and "chalky" in a pleasing way.45
Flavor Carrier: The neutral flavor of the starch highlights the filling: Dulce de Leche.
9.2 The Dulce de Leche Requirement
The filling must be Dulce de Leche Repostero (confectioner’s style). Standard dulce de leche or caramel sauce is too runny and will cause the cookie to slide apart. The cookie is traditionally rolled in desiccated coconut, which provides a necessary textural barrier, preventing sticky fingers and adding a chew that contrasts with the melting dough.
