Peanut Butter Cookie: Elevating the Legume
Peanut butter cookies fall into the "dense fat" category. The high oil and protein content of peanut butter can lead to a heavy, cloying mouthfeel. The "noteworthy" recipes in this category use salt and texture to break up this density.
4.1 The City Bakery "Salty-Sweet" Phenomenon
The "Salty-Sweet Peanut Butter Sandies" from City Bakery (NYC) are arguably the most famous iteration of this cookie in the last two decades.24
The Double-Salt Technique
The genius of this recipe lies in its surface treatment. The cookies are rolled in sugar before baking, but they are also sprinkled with coarse sea salt.24
Salivary Stimulation: The salt crystals hit the tongue first, stimulating saliva production. This counteracts the natural "pastiness" of the peanut butter, which tends to stick to the roof of the mouth.25
Sandiness: The recipe uses a high ratio of peanut butter to flour, creating a "sandy" (short) texture that dissolves rather than chews. This is achieved by using European-style butter (lower water content), which prevents the gluten from developing too strongly.25
4.2 The "Peanubbin" Texture (Serious Eats)
Serious Eats takes a different approach, focusing on the homogeneity of the nut. They recommend using chunky peanut butter and folding in whole roasted peanuts.26
Textural Contrast: This creates a cookie with three levels of peanut texture: the smooth dough, the small grit of the chunky butter, and the large crunch of the whole nut. This concept, referred to as "peanubbins," transforms the cookie from a uniform paste into a complex pastry with varying resistance to the bite.26
Honey Roasted Variation: Stella Parks suggests using honey-roasted peanuts ground into a paste. The honey adds a floral sweetness that pairs with the savory notes of the peanut, evoking the flavor profile of a Payday bar.
