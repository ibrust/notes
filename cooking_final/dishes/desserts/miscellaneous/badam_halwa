Badam Halwa (India)
The Almond Saffron Pudding
While Kaju Katli is a fudge, Badam Halwa (Almond Halwa) is a rich, gelatinous pudding made from blanched almonds, ghee (clarified butter), sugar, and saffron.28 It is considered a more decadent and labor-intensive dessert, often reserved for weddings or high festivities.
Technical Composition: Ghee and Saffron
The almonds are soaked, peeled, and ground to a paste, then cooked slowly with ghee and sugar. The key to a master-level Badam Halwa is the quantity of ghee; the almond paste must "swim" in the ghee to prevent burning and to achieve a translucent, glossy sheen.30 Saffron is added not just for color but for its metallic, floral flavor that pairs exceptionally well with almonds.29
Sensory Profile
The texture is soft, scoopable, and grainy in a pleasing way (unlike the smooth Kaju Katli). The flavor is intense almond, butter, and saffron. It is served warm, which volatilizes the saffron and almond aromas, creating a heady olfactory experience.
