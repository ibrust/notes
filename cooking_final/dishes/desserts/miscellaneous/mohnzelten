Mohnzelten
A specialty of the Waldviertel region in Austria, Mohnzelten differs from the strudel-style rolls by using a potato-based dough.34

These are palm-sized, flat discs. The ratio is extreme—a thin skin of potato dough encasing a thick puck of poppy filling. They are less sweet than Makowiec and have a savory, hearty quality ideal for breakfast or hiking snacks.
Architectural Analysis: The Potato Matrix
1. The Dough:
The use of boiled, riced potatoes mixed with flour and butter creates a "short" dough that is soft and slightly chewy. It lacks the elasticity of the yeast dough used in Makowiec, meaning it crumbles pleasantly rather than stretching.
2. The High-Heat Bake:
Unlike the slow roast of a log, Mohnzelten are often baked at high heat (400°F/200°C) to brown the potato dough quickly while keeping the interior moist.
