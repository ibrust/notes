Black Sesame Paris-Brest
Moving to the black variety of sesame (kuro-goma), we encounter a seed with a more robust, earthy, and slightly bitter profile compared to white sesame because the hull is intact. The application of black sesame in French pastry techniques, specifically pâte à choux, demonstrates high-level fusion.11
The Master Organoleptic Profile
The Paris-Brest is traditionally a ring of choux pastry filled with praline crème mousseline (hazelnut/almond). The seed-based variant replaces the nut praline with a black sesame paste. A master version balances the inherent bitterness of the black sesame hull against the richness of the buttercream and the sweetness of the choux dough. The cream should be charcoal-grey, smooth (not gritty), and have a savory undertone that prevents the dessert from becoming cloying.12
Architectural Analysis: The Emulsion Stability
1. The Paste Production:
One cannot simply grind raw seeds. They must be toasted to release the oils. The master technique involves grinding the toasted seeds with a small amount of honey or neutral oil to create a paste before adding it to the dairy. If dry ground seeds are added directly to the pastry cream, they will absorb moisture from the custard, thickening it unpredictably and creating a gritty mouthfeel.12
2. The Crème Mousseline:
The filling is a mixture of pastry cream (milk, sugar, egg yolks, starch) and butter. The introduction of sesame oil (via the paste) changes the fat structure.
Temperature Shock: The butter and the pastry cream must be at the same temperature when combined. Adding the sesame paste, which is often dense and oily, requires vigorous emulsification. If the mixture splits, the mouthfeel becomes greasy.
pH Sensitivity: Black sesame contains anthocyanins (pigments). In highly acidic environments, they can turn red; in alkaline, they turn green/blue. A neutral pastry cream maintains the desirable deep grey/black hue.13
3. The Choux Pastry:
The choux bun itself is often topped with a craquelin (a cookie crust) made with black sesame flour and butter. This adds a necessary textural crunch to contrast the soft cream. The "master" execution ensures the choux is baked thoroughly dry so it does not become soggy from the moisture of the sesame cream.
