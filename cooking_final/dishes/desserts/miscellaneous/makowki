The Layered Poppy Soak
A traditional Christmas Eve dish, Makówki consists of layers of bread (often Challah or sweet buns) alternating with a dense mixture of ground poppy seeds cooked with honey, milk, and butter.58
Texture: The dish is chilled overnight. The bread absorbs moisture from the poppy seed mass, softening into a cake-like consistency. The poppy seeds provide a unique, gritty, nutty texture that is beloved in Central Europe.59
Flavor: Intense poppy flavor (earthy, nutty) sweetened with honey. It is heavy and rich, often symbolizing prosperity.5
