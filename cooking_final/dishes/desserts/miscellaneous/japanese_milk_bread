Japanese Milk Bread (Shokupan): The Triumph of Tangzhong
Shokupan is the gold standard for white bread, renowned for its impossible fluffiness, bounce, and shreddability.42 While often a breakfast staple, enriched versions (using cream and butter) stand as a dessert bread in their own right, often serving as the base for high-end fruit sandwiches.
The Tangzhong (Yudane) Mechanism
The secret to Shokupan is starch gelatinization. A portion of the flour is cooked with liquid (water or milk) to 65°C to form a paste (Tangzhong) before being added to the main dough.44
The Science: Cooking the flour causes the starch granules to swell and burst, absorbing significantly more water than they would at room temperature.
The Effect: This bound water creates a dough with high hydration that is not sticky to handle. Upon baking, the water is released slowly, steaming the bread from the inside and delaying retrogradation (staling).20
Sensory Profile: Mild, milky, and sweet. The texture is the protagonist—feathery, peeling away in wisps, with a soft "bounce" that is unique to this method.
