Maja Blanca
Origin: Philippines
Primary Grain: Cornstarch and Sweet Corn Kernels
Historical and Cultural Context
Maja Blanca is a Filipino adaptation of the Spanish Manjar Blanco, but replacing almond milk and gelatin with coconut milk and cornstarch.50 It is a "fiesta" food, prized for its ease of preparation and rich flavor.
Taste and Texture Profile
This is a set pudding (blancmange style) with a smooth, gelatinous consistency derived from cornstarch. The base flavor is coconut and dairy (evaporated or condensed milk), punctuated by the pop of sweet corn kernels.50 The essential counterpoint is the topping of Latik—toasted coconut curds. The Latik provides a smoky, nutty crunch and an oily richness that prevents the pudding from feeling too dry or "clean".52
Technical Execution and Chemistry
The choice of thickener is non-negotiable: it must be cornstarch (gawgaw), not corn flour or wheat flour. Cornstarch creates a translucent, tender gel, whereas flour would result in an opaque, pasty texture with a raw cereal taste.54 The production of Latik involves simmering coconut cream until the water evaporates and the oil separates from the solids, which then fry in their own fat—a process requiring careful heat management to avoid burning
