Brazilian Passion Fruit Mousse (Mousse de Maracujá)
This is arguably the simplest recipe on this list in terms of ingredient count, yet it relies on a specific chemical reaction that is often overlooked in Western cookery.
12.1 Acid Coagulation
The traditional French mousse relies on egg whites or gelatin for structure. The Brazilian Passion Fruit Mousse uses neither. It is made by blending sweetened condensed milk, heavy cream (or creme de leite), and concentrated passion fruit pulp.
The Mechanism: The high acidity of the passion fruit juice reacts with the casein proteins in the condensed milk and cream. This acid coagulation thickens the mixture naturally, similar to the setting of a Posset or Key Lime Pie filling.
Aeration: The mixture is blended for several minutes. This mechanical action incorporates air bubbles which are then trapped by the thickening proteins, creating a light, airy texture.48
12.2 The Cream Variable
Authentic recipes call for Creme de Leite (table cream), which has a lower fat content and different stabilizers than US Heavy Cream. However, a mixture of heavy cream and condensed milk works well. The Master Recipe garnishes this with fresh passion fruit pulp. The crunch of the seeds is a polarizing but essential element, providing textural contrast to the smooth mousse and a burst of unadulterated sourness.
