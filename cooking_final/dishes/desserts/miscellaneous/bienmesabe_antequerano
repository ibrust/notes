Bienmesabe Antequerano (Spain)
The Moorish Almond Cream
"Bienmesabe" translates to "It tastes good to me." While there are versions in Venezuela (coconut) and the Canary Islands, the Bienmesabe Antequerano from mainland Spain is a historic almond masterpiece with Moorish (Arab) roots.55
Technical Composition: Liquid Marzipan
This dessert is essentially a soft, spoonable marzipan. It is made by cooking ground almonds in a sugar syrup with lemon zest and cinnamon, then thickening it with egg yolks.55 It is often served on a base of sponge cake or ladyfingers to soak up the rich almond cream.
Sensory Profile
The texture is "grainy and unctuous" 56, coating the palate with sweet almond oil and sugar. The inclusion of lemon zest and cinnamon is non-negotiable, cutting through the lipid density with brightness and spice. It is an intense, concentrated almond experience.
