Alegría
Alegría ("Joy") is a Mexican candy made from popped amaranth seeds bound with honey or sugar syrup. It dates back to Aztec religious ceremonies.44
The Master Organoleptic Profile
It functions similarly to a Rice Krispie treat but with a much nuttier, toasted flavor profile. It should be light and airy, not a dense brick.
Architectural Analysis: The Pop Physics
1. The Comal Technique:
Amaranth seeds are tiny. Popping them is difficult because they burn milliseconds after popping. They require a surface temperature of approx 400°F+. They are popped in small batches (tablespoons at a time) on a clay comal or wok. If the heat is too low, they toast without expanding (parched corn effect); too high, they incinerate.44
2. The Syrup Stage:
The binding syrup (piloncillo or honey) must be cooked to the "hard ball" stage. If acid (lime juice) is added, it prevents crystallization, keeping the bar slightly chewy. If omitted, the bar becomes brittle.
