Om Ali: The Middle Eastern Texture Study
The "Mother of Ali"
Om Ali (or Umm Ali) is an Egyptian bread pudding with a history steeped in folklore (often associated with Shajar al-Durr and the Mamluk era). Unlike Western bread puddings that use brioche or loaf bread, Om Ali uses pastry—specifically puff pastry (goulash), toasted flatbread (roaa), or Palmiers—which is baked until crisp before being soaked.22
The Crunch-Soak Dynamic
The critical distinction of Om Ali is the texture of the starch component. Because it uses flaky pastry (often broken into shards) rather than porous bread, the pudding retains a textural contrast even after the hot sweetened milk and cream are poured over it. The top layer, often covered in thick cream (qashta), broils to a golden crisp, while the underside becomes a soft, milky porridge.24
The Nut and Fruit Inclusion
The pudding is heavily interspersed with texture modifiers: pistachios, toasted almonds, pine nuts, raisins, and desiccated coconut. This makes every bite a mix of soft, creamy, crunchy, and chewy elements, distinguishing it from the uniform consistency of a custard.
Best Practices for the Master Recipe
The "best" versions avoid using croissants (which can become too soggy) and opt for crisp puff pastry or Palmiers to maintain structural integrity. It is best served hot, straight from the oven, when the contrast between the crisp top and milky bottom is most pronounced.
