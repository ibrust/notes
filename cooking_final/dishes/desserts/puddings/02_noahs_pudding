NOAH'S PUDDING - DONE
===================================================

This dish traces its origins all the way back to neolithic times when wheat was first domesticated. 

The philosophy of Asure is unity in multiplicity. 
    Tradition dictates the use of at least seven ingredients, though some historical iterations have had as many as 40.

The name is a reference to Noah's Ark. 
    The story goes that Asura was first created with the ingredients remaining on Noah's Ark when it landed.
    In reality this name probably was meant as an allusion to the multiplicity of ingredients, 
    similar to diversity of creatures on the Ark. 

For a modern, taste-centered iteration of Asura, throwing too many ingredients together often results in muddied flavors. 
    This modernized recipe will curate the ingredient list to the most essential, flavorful components. 
    It'll leverage the creaminess of wheat, citrus zest (to cut through the starch), legumes, figs, and nuts. 

It's worth referring to top-tier Turkish culinary sources to determine what our goal is. 
    The Asura should be naturally thickened by wheat starch. 
        It should coat the back of a spoon (nappe consistency). It should flow, but also hold its suspension.

    While taste is the priority, murkey gray pudding often indicates the leaching of tannins and oxidized, astringent compounds.
        The pudding should be white or translucent gold. 
        This requires precise management of the figs and walnuts. 

    The wheat must be bloomed (fully gelatinized adn exploded). 
    The beans should be soft but intact. 
        Undercooked beans are a catastrophic failure in Asure. They introduce a gritty chalkiness that isn't dessert-like. 
    The dried fruit should be plump, not leathery. 

    The pudding should be sweet, but its sugar should not mask the natural nutty flavor of the barley and chickpeas. 
        The finish should have a lingering orange taste, not a heavy sugary aftertaste. 


The quality of the grains and fruits, and how they're processed, is critical. 

    Wheat is the soul of Asure. In Turkey, the specific variety of wheat used is peeled or hulled wheat (called aşurelik buğday). 
        This is a whole grain wheat that has the outer bran removed but retains the endosperm and germ. 
        While some Western versions use pearl barley as a substitute, we'll use peeled wheat or whole grain barley if unavailable. 
            Barley only imperfectly mimics the specific type of starch release, so hulled wheat is preferred

    Wheat starch (amylose and amylopectin) gelatinizes between 125-145F, but the grain itself requires 
        prolonged exposure to heat to break down the protein network. 
    Wheat is a hard grain. To ensure it cooks evenly without turning into mush on the outside but remaining chalky inside, 
        it must undergo a two stage hydration process: 

            1) a long soak overnight 
            2) a vigorous boil 

        This hydration allows water to penetrate the dense protein network of the endosperm, 
            reducing the cooking time and ensuring even gelatinization. 


The inclusion of beans in a dessert is somewhat confusing. 
    They provide an essential meaty texture, and a savory counterpoint to the sugar. 
    They create a complex flavor that isn't one-dimensional. 

    We'll use medium-sized dried chickpeas (Ram is ideal if available). 
        Canned chickpeas are permissible, but for the best taste, dried chickpeas cooked from scratch offer superior creaminess. 
        They also lack the metallic aftertaste of canning brine. 

    White beans (Haricot / Navy / Canellini) contribute a buttery texture. 
        The skin thickness of these is critical. Thin skinned beans (like Ispir or Dermason) are preferred so they don't 
        leave fibrous husks in the dessert. 

    The beans must be cooked separately from the wheat. 
        Beans and wheat have different softening points. 
        Cooking them together from the start results in one disintegrating before the other is tender. 
        Furthermore, the cooking water of beans contains raffinose family oligosaccharides (which clause flatulence)
        and strong earthy flavors that should be discarded in a dessert. 

    Professionals also often include a small amount of short-grain rice (Baldo or Osmancik). 
        This rice breaks down almost entirely during cooking, releasing alot of amylopectin that acts as a binder. 
        This reduces or eliminates the need for a thickener like cornstarch. 

    To maximize the clarity of flavors we use water as the primary solvent. 
        We'll wash the wheat until it's absolutely clear to ensure the water remains bright. 
        A splash of milk can be added at the very end if desired, but is not strictly necessary, and can mute the orange zest. 

    We'll use unsulphured Malatya apricots. 

    Figs contain thousands of tiny seeds and dark compounds (anthocyanins and tannins). 
        They turn the water mrukey gray or black. 
        Figs add a crutical crunch and deep honey flavor, but their usage requires pre-boiling.

    Golden raisins are preferred to dark raisins to provide a lighter sweetness and maintain the light color.

    Orange zest is the secret weapon. It cuts through the starch and sugar. We'll use strips of rind. 


Different culinary schools diverge in their approach to making Asure. 

    Traditionalists emphasize regional authenticity and seasonality in their Asure formulations. 
        They'll typically rely heavily on the natural thickening power of grains. 
        They'll focus on the integrity of the beans and the stewy aspect of the dish. 
        The flavor profile is earthy and deeply traditional. 

    Modernists focus more on accessibility and visual appealing. 
        They'll often use cornstarch to ensure consistent texture (pudding-like rather than soup-like). 
        Sometimes they'll incorporate milk for whiteness. 

    Scientific approaches focus on starch gelatinization curves, 
        emphasizing the overnight soak to reduce energy consumption and ensure even hydration.

        Some naive cooksmay  add sugar early, with the beans. 
        But food science dictates adding sugar last. 
            Sugar is hygroscopic. It competes with the cell walls of the beand and wheat for water. 
            If added too early, the high osmotic pressure prevents the hemicellulose in beans skins from breaking down,
            resulting in beans that stay permanently crunchy.
            We'll add sugar only after all grains and legumes are fully tender.

orange zest, 1 orange worth 

filtered water, ~4 quarts 
granulated sugar, 2.5 cups (add more to taste if needed)
salt, 0.5 tsp 
rose water, 1 tbsp (optional)

whole cloves, 6-8 (boiled separately)
cinnamon stick, 1 large 

walnuts, 1 cup, roughly chopped (keep separate until serving)

===================================================
PREPARATION 
===================================================

1) pre-soak the wheat 
    a) wash 1.5 cups of peeled wheat thoroughly.
        rub the grains between your hands under cold running water until the water runs completely clear. 
        this removes surface dust and loose starch that causes murkiness. 
    b) place the hweat in a large pot (this pot will become a cooking vessel)
    c) cover the wheat with 4 inches of water 
    d) bring to a boil 
    e) let it boil for 10 minutes 
    f) turn off the heat
    g) cover with a lid
    h) let it sit overnight (or at least 8 hours).
        the wheat wlil absorb the water and bloom (expand). 
        do not drain this water, it will contain important starch.

2) pre-soak the beans
    a) place chickpeas and white beans in two separate bowls 
    b) cover both with plenty of water (3x their volume at least) 
    c) if your water is hard, add a pinch of baking soda to the chickpeas to help soften the pectin in their skins 
    d) leave overnight 
    e) you can replace the bean water halfway through (optional)

________________________________________________________________________

3) boil the chickpeas 
    a) drain the chickpeas and white beans 
    b) place chickpeas in a pot with fresh water 
    c) boil the chickpeas until soft but not falling apart (~40-60 minutes)
        test by squishing one. it should yield easily with no hard center
    d) once cooked, drain and set aside

4) boil the white beans 
    a) place the white beans in a separate pot with fresh water 
    b) boil until soft (~30-45 minutes) 
    c) once cooked, drain and set aside

5) process the dark fruits 
    a) dice the dried figs and apricots into bite-sized cubes 
    b) placed the drigs figs, raisins, and currents in a small saucepan 
    c) cover with water and bring to a boil 
    d) boil for 4-5 minutes
    e) drain the water 
    f) rinse the fruit under cold water (mainly for color) 

6) simmer the wheat and rice
    a) the soaking wheat will now be swollen / will have absorbed most of the water. 
        add fresh water to the bloomed wheat to bring the total water to ~3.5 quarts
    b) rinse 3 tbsp of rice under cold water
    c) add the rice to the pot 
    d) bring the mixture to a boil over medium-high heat 
    e) once boiling, reduce to a simmer (190-200F)
    g) simmer for 20-30 minutes until the wheat releases its starch and the liquid begins to turn creamy & opaque 
        if foam rises, skim it off. 
    
7) prepare the cloves (during the 20-30 minute simmer)
    a) boil the cloves in a half cup of water separately
    b) strain out the cloves 

8) add ingredients to the pot & continue simmering
    a) add the cinnamon stick 
    b) add the orange zest strips 
    c) add the clove-infused water to the pot 
    d) add the cooked and drained chickpeas and white beans to the pot 
    e) add the diced apricots 
    f) simmer for another 15 minutes. 
        stir frequently during this time to prevent sticking at the bottom. 
        the mixture is thickening, and the wheat starch is coating the beans 

9) add remaining ingredients 
    a) add 2.5 cups of sugar 
    b) stir well to dissolve the sugar 
    c) taste the liquid and add more sugar, up to 3 total cups, if needed. 
        remember, the pudding tastes less sweet when cold, so it should taste just slightly too sweet when hot.  
    d) add 0.5 tsp salt 
    e) add the figs
    f) add the raisins
    g) add the currants 

10) the final simmer 
    a) simmer for a final 10-15 minutes. 
        the consistency should be like thick soup 
    b) take a spoonful of liquid and place it on a cold plate. 
        if it gels slightly after a minute, it's ready. 
        if it's too watery, you can mash a few tablespoons of beans against the pot to release more starch 
    c) remove the cinnamon stick
    d) stir in 1 tbsp rose water 

11) finishing 
    a) transfer the liquid into bowls. 
        the fruit tends to sink, so stir the main pot as you transfer it to ensure you get the fruit into the bowls
    b) put the bowls in the fridge to cool them down. 
        a skin will form on top. this is desirable.
        beans are prone to fermentation, so ensure the soup is cooled quickly.
    c) when serving, garnish with the following: 
        i) chopped walnuts. 
            you don't add these until the end, because the skins will turn the pudding bitter 
        ii) pamegranate seeds 
        iii) crushed pistachio 
        iv) cinnamon powder
