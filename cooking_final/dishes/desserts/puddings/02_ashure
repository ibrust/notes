Ashure (Noah's Pudding): The Turkish Symbolic Grain
The "Oldest Dessert in the World"
Ashure (or Aşure) is uniquely significant as it is often cited as the oldest dessert in history, commemorating the landing of Noah's Ark. Legend holds that it was created from the last scraps of food remaining on the Ark.64
Ingredients and Texture
Ashure challenges the "creamy" definition of pudding. It is a porridge-like mixture of wheat berries, chickpeas, white beans (navy beans), dried fruits (apricots, figs, raisins), and nuts. It is thickened by the starch from the wheat and pulses.64
Taste Profile: It is sweet, fruity, and nutty, but the inclusion of beans gives it a distinct earthiness. The texture is complex—chewy wheat, soft beans, crunchy nuts—offering a departure from the smooth custards of Europe.66
