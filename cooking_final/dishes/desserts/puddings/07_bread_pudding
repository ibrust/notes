 New Orleans Bread Pudding Soufflé: The American Innovation
Evolution from Stale Bread to Haute Cuisine
Bread pudding is traditionally a humble dish, created to salvage stale bread by soaking it in a custard mixture.1 However, the New Orleans culinary tradition, specifically at the legendary Commander's Palace, elevated this rustic dish into a "soufflé" hybrid that is widely considered one of the best puddings in the United States.17
The Soufflé Technique
Standard bread pudding can be dense and heavy. The Commander's Palace innovation involves preparing a standard spiced bread pudding base (using New Orleans-style French bread, which has a crisp crust and airy interior), and then folding in a meringue (whipped egg whites and sugar) before the final bake.18
The Rise: The meringue causes the heavy bread mixture to puff and rise into a dome.
The Texture: The result is a dessert that retains the custardy, comforting flavor of bread pudding but possesses a lightness described as "cloudlike" or "poufy".17
The Whiskey Sauce Component
The dish is incomplete without the warm whiskey sauce. Unlike the cold pouring cream of British puddings or the caramel of flan, the New Orleans sauce is an emulsion of butter, sugar, egg, and bourbon. At Commander's Palace, the ritual involves the waiter poking a hole in the soufflé dome and pouring the sauce directly into the center, ensuring the liquid permeates the hot, airy structure.17
Comparison: Commander's Palace vs. Bon Ton Cafe
While Commander's Palace offers the soufflé version, the Bon Ton Cafe in New Orleans is famous for a more traditional, denser bread pudding. The Bon Ton recipe is noted for its high butter content and a sauce that uses a rapid emulsion of egg and hot sugar to prevent curdling.20
Commander's Palace: Airy, refined, meringue-lifted. Focuses on lightness and presentation.
Bon Ton Cafe: Dense, buttery, traditional. Focuses on richness and the saturation of the bread.21
