RICE PUDDING - DONE
===================================================

A good rice pudding relies on: 
    1) precise gelatinization of rice starch
    2) controlled denaturation of egg protein
    3) maillard-toasting of dairy solids

You want rice pudding to have a a dual texture. 
    it should be a creamy, suspended starch matrix that contains distinct, slightly chewy grains. 

The behavior of rice in a fluid medium is dictated by the ratio of amylose to amylopectin in the endosperm. 
    amylopectin is branched-chain polysaccharides whereas amylose is linear. 
    
    their ratio determines how the rice cooks, thickens the liquid, and behaves upon cooling (retrogradation)

    during cooking the polysaccharides break down (called gelatinization) 

    high amylose rice varieties (basmati, jasmine - typically 20-25% amylose) require more time/energy to hydrate.
        Upon cooling, linear amylose molecules realign rapidly into a rigid structure. 

        In a rice pudding this would result in distinct, separate grains that lack cohesiveness. 
            As the pudding tools these grains harden, making the pudding grainy and chalky rather than creamy. 

    high amylopectin rice varieties (japonica, glutinous rice) have a lower gelatinization temperature and swell more. 
        the branched structure prevents tight realignment upon cooling, so the it remains softer and more fluid. 

        However, amylopecton is also responsible for stickiness. 
            In excess, it can cause the rice grains to dissolve entirely into a cohesive glue. 

    Arborio rice is the ideal strain for bread pudding.
        This is an italian strain developed for risotto. 
        It has a high amylopectin exterior that soughs off easily during agitation, which thickens the milk. 
        It also has a chalky, high-amylose center (the perla) that remains firm even after prolonged cooking. 

        This dichotomy allows us to cook the pudding until the liquid is thick and creamy without it turning to mush. 

Some authorities suggest boiling the rice for a short time in water to hydrate it. 
    This does hydrate it, but it's a missed opportunity for flavor infusion. 
    Rice absorbs the liquid inwhich it's cooked. 
        If the liquid is water, the interior of the grain tastes like water. 
        If the liquid is milk, the grain tastes milky. 

    Furthermore, pre-cooked rice releases less starch into the final pudding, 
        which will mean we must put less liquid into it, compromising flavor. 

Instead we will use a Risotto technique - saute the rice in butter (~300-300F) before adding the milk to it. 
This serves 3 critical functions:
    1) it initiates the Maillard reaction on the surface of the rice and on the milk solids in the butter 
    2) the fat coats the individual rice grains, creating a lipid barrier. 
        This will slow the milks initial pentration of the rice, 
            preventing it from absorbing it too quickly and bursting. 
        This allows for a longer cooking time, which facilitates greater evaporation and concentration 
            of the milk without destroying the rice. 
    3) The lipid coating lubricates the grains, preventing them from clumping early on before hydration is complete. 


The "pudding" texture of the liquid is determined by the interaction between the milk and dissolved starches / sugars. 

    Heavy cream is high in fat, but low in water content, which can hindre starch gelatinization. 
        To swell the starch needs water, not fat. 
        Cooking the rice in cream would result in undercooked, hard grains and a broken, greasy emulsion. 
    Whole milk is the ideal medium. 
        It contains sufficient water for efficient starch hydration. 
        It also contains lactose (milk sugar), proteins (casein/whey), and fat. 
        As the milk reduces, lactose anad protiens will be concentrated. 
            This creates a flavor similar to condensed milk - rich, sweet, and complex. 


Typical recipes call for a liquid-to-rice ratio of 4:1. 
    This is insufficient for a premium result. It hydrates the rice but leaves little excess liquid for the pudding.
    Upon cooling, the starch retrogrdes and the structure collapses into a solid block. 
To achieve a flowing pudding consistency we use a high-reduction technique. 
    The ratio will be closer to 12:1, but we'll simmer it for an extended period. 
        This will allow the rice to fully release its starch into the liquid. 
        It also facilitates the Maillard reaction of lactose and milk proteins. 

    Some sites suggest 6:1, others go as high as 17:1, but 12:1 is a good balance.
    With a 12:1 ratio it should take about 45-60 minutes of simmering to concentrate the flavor.


While starch provides texture, it doesn't provide lubrication or lipidity. 
    For this, we will use egg yolks. 
    The lecithin and liporoteins in the yolks will coat the starch and fat molecules, creating a smooth emulsion. 

Tempered egg yolks will be added at the end of cooking. 
We also will only use the yolks, we will discard the whites. 
    Whites coagulate at a lower temperature and can create a rubby or sulferous structure that is less creamy. 

The adding of sugar is also chemically significant. 
    Sucrose is highly hygroscopic (water-attracting). 
        In the cooking liquid, sugar will compete with starch for available water. 
        This competition increases the temperature required for starch to gelatinize. 
    
    If the sugar was added in the beginning, the rice grains may never fully soften, regardless of cooking time. 
        To avoid this, we add the majority of sugar toward the end of cooking, after the rice is 90% tender. 
        

For vanilla we'll use a bean in the beginning (which contains hundreds of complex compounds) and extract at the end. 
    Boiling vanilla bean infuses the milk. 
    Adding extact at the end preserves the delicate volatiles that would otherwise evaporate during cooking. 

Salt potentiates flavor. 
    In sweet dairy, it suppresses bitterness and amplifies perceived sweetness and creaminess. 
    A lack of salt is a big reason for bland taste. 

We'll also add some orange or lemon zest strips (not grated) during the simmer.
    This provides a critical counterpoint to the rich fats, and prevents palate fatigue. 

We can optionally add golden raisens, but they'll need to be rehydrated. 
    the cuticle (waxy coating) of the raisin prevents water from coming in. 
    As the cuticle is heated it becomes more permeable and the rehydration rate increases. 
    But if it's heated too far (past 170F) the heat can strip away the cuticle entirely, and the raisin may disintegrate.

    Heating the liquid also allows the internal solids in the raisin to soak up water better. 

    Also note that golden raisins rehydrate faster due to the way they're processed (which compromises their cuticle)

    However, we're going to soak the raisins in orange juice, which requires more osmotic drive, i.e. higher temperatures. 

    We'll rehydrate the raisins for 90 minutes in orange juice initially heated to 165F.

RARE INGREDIENTS
===================================================

arborio rice
1 vanilla bean (or 1 tbsp paste if unavailable) 
1 cinnamon stick

===================================================
INGREDIENTS
===================================================

arborio rice, 1/2 cup, 100g
unsalted butter, 2 tablespoons
whole milk, 5-6 cups, 1.4 L
sugar (granulated), 1/2 cup, 100g
salt (kosher), 1/2 teaspoon
vanilla bean, 1 whole (or 1 tbsp vanilla paste)
cinnamon stick, 1 whole - use Ceylon cinnamon for complex floral notes, or Cassia for classic heat.
orange zest, 2 strips (not grated)
egg yolks, 2 large
heavy cream, 1/2 cup
vanilla extract, 1 teaspoon
6 green cardamom pods, lightly cracked (optional)

===================================================
PREPARATION 
===================================================

1) presoak the raisins (if you're using raisins) 
    a) heat 300g of orange juice in a saucepan to 165F 
    b) add 75g of golden raisins 
    c) cover & allow to sit for 150 minutes.
        move to step 2 after about 60 minutes

2) do the risotto saute
    a) put 2 tbsp unsalted butter in an unheated dutch oven
    b) begin heating the dutch oven over medium-low heat
    c) cook the butter until it's in the pale blonde phase, which takes ~3-5 minutes to reach. 
        At pale blonde the sizzling sound will fade to a quiet gentle foam, informing you that the water is gone. 
        The bubbling will shift from large, clear bubbles to a dense, white foam. 
        The milk solids at the bottom should look golden-yellow (like lemonade or pale beer), not brown.
    d) add the 1/2 cup arborio rice. 
        the rice should not be washed, that'd prevent it from toasting 
        this will temporarily shock the butter out of cooking, though not for long
    e) stir constantly with the spatula. 
        you are coating every grain of rice
        it will begin to foam
    f) cook for 3-4 minutes. look for the browning of the butter as your queue to stop. 
        the goal is for the browning of the butter to finish the same time the rice is finishing 
        the edges of the rice should become translucent, and the rice should have a pale golden hue

3) simmer the rice 
    a) add 5 cups of whole milk (saving 1 cup for later) 
        it will sputter violently. 
        stir immediately to stop the browning of butter. 
    b) add in the spices: 
        i) scraped vanilla seeds / vanilla pod (or 1 tbsp vanilla paste)
        ii) cinnamon stick (broken in half)
        iii) orange zest, 2 strips (not grated)
        iv) 1/2 tsp salt 
        v) 6 cardamon pods, lightly cracked (optional)
    c) bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low
        the liquid should be ~200F, barely bubbling
    d) cook uncovered for 45-55 minutes 
        you must stir it at least every 5-8 minutes 
        the stirring action will knock hydrated starches off the surface of the rice into the milk. 
        this is what thickens the pudding, and is the goal 
        use the bubbles as the queue to know it's ~200F.
            leaving the heat on 3-4 and not stirring until after 1-2 min when bubbles start forming is a good strategy
    e) at ~45 minutes taste a grain of rice. 
        it should be tender with no chalkiness, but still offer slight resistance (al dente). 
        if the liquid has evaporated but the rice is still hard, add the reserved 1 cup of milk in 1/4 increments 

4) sweeten
    a) only after the rice is tender:
        i) stir in the 1/2 cup of sugar
        ii) drain & stir in the raisins
    b) continue to simmer for 5-10 minutes afterwards 
        the mixture will temporarily thin as sugar dissolves and interferes with the starch network.
        then it will thicken again
        the pudding should resemble a heavy cream soup. 
        It should be looser than what you want the final result to be. 
        If it stands up on peaks, it is too thick, so add more milk. 

5) temper the egg yolks & emulsify
    a) in a bowl whisk 2 egg yolks and 1/2 cup heavy cream 
    b) to prevent the eggs from curdling upon contact with the pudding: 
        i) take about 1/2 cup of the pudding liquid (avoiding rice grains) out of the pot
        ii) slowly drizzle the hot liquid into the egg / cream bowl while whisky vigorously 
            this raises the temperature of the eggs to ~110-120F
        iii) repeat with another 1/2 cup of pudding liquid
        iv) turn the main pot heat down to low
        v) wait 1-2 minutes to ensure the pot temperature drops to 175-180F. It should not be bubbling
        vi) pour the tempered egg mixture into the main pot, stirring continuously 
    c) cook on low heat for 2-3 minutes, stirring constantly. 
        it should be 170F-175F (though at the very least it should reach 160F for food safety) 
        do not let it reach higher temperature, the egg could scramble.  
        the egg proteins should coagulate enough to thicken the liquid into a custard

6) finishing 
    a) turn off the heat
    b) remove the vanilla pod (if used), cinnamon stick, and orange strips 

    c) stir in 1 tsp of vanilla extract
        ensure the pot is ~170F or lower when you do this
        adding the extract off heat prevents the alcohol-based flavor compounds from flashing off 
    d) pour into a serving dish (so that it cools off) 
    e) allow it to cool to warm room temperature
        the starch will retrograde slightly, firming the pudding up 
        it is best served warm or at room temperature. refridgeration will make it significantly firmer

TEST RESULTS / ADJUSTMENTS
===================================================

- I may add more liquid (6 cups of milk) and cook longer (I only went 45, but would rather go 55)
- I was stirring frequently, which lowered the temperature. To compensate, I raised the heat. 
    I believe the result of this was a faster reduction. 
    Toward the end I found leaving the heat on 3-4 and not distrubing it until bubbles started forming was a good strategy

TROUBLESHOOTING
===================================================

- if the milk has reduced to a thick sludge, but the rice grains are still crunchy in the middle,
    the heat may have been too high or you may have added to teh sugar too early. 
    don't cook any longer, you'll just burn the pudding. 
    add 1/2 cup h ot water (water penetrates better than milk at this stage).
    cover and cook on lowest possible setting for 10 minutes
    the steam pressure will force hydration

- if the pudding separates into a solid mass of rice and a pool of watery liquid after cooling,
    this is retrogradation gone wrong. If the putting was cooked until it was too thick (over-gelatinized),
    the starch network becomes too tight upon cooling. As the amylose re-bonds, they squeeze water out of the matrix. 
    This is why you stop cooking when the pudding is still soupy. 

- if there are small yellow specks in the pudding it means the egg yolks were heated about 180F. 
    at this temperature the protieins (ovotransferrin) tighten aggressively, squeezing out water and fat, 
    resulting in solid curds. 
    you can try vigorously whisking it to re-emulsify the yolk lipids. 

- if a brown layer stuck to the bottom of the pan and there's a bitter acrid taste throughout,
    it's because milk solids settled to the bottom adn burned. 
    it may have been because agitation was insiffucient. 
    do not scrape the bottom. if you smell burning, pour the unburnt top layer of pudding into a new clean pot immediately.
