Rice Pudding (Kheer & Global Variants): The Grain Essential
The Starch Release
Rice pudding relies on the gelatinization of rice starch to thicken the milk. It is one of the most ancient forms of pudding, existing in nearly every culture that cultivates rice.
Kheer (South Asian)
Kheer is distinguished by the use of Basmati rice and the reduction method. Unlike Western rice puddings which might be baked with eggs, Kheer is typically cooked on the stovetop by simmering milk until it reduces and thickens naturally. It is flavored with cardamom, saffron, rose water, and nuts.56
Texture: Kheer is fluid and pourable, not solid. The Basmati grains remain distinct but soft.
Flavor: Floral and aromatic, contrasting with the vanilla-heavy Western versions.57
The "Creamiest" Western Versions
The search for the "best" rice pudding often lands on stovetop methods that use short-grain or Arborio rice. These grains have a higher amylopectin content, releasing more starch and creating a risotto-like creaminess without the need for eggs. "Diner-style" rice pudding often incorporates eggs for a custard-like set, but the purest creamy texture comes from the slow breakdown of the rice grain itself.
