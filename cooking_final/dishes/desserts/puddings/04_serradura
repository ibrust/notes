Serradura: The Macanese Sawdust Pudding
Minimalist Construction
Serradura is a famous dessert from Macau (a former Portuguese colony). Its name translates to "sawdust," referring to the texture of finely crushed Marie biscuits (tea biscuits).70
Ingredient Synergy
It consists of only three primary ingredients: heavy whipping cream, sweetened condensed milk, and crushed biscuits. The cream is whipped with the condensed milk to soft peaks (a no-cook mousse), and then layered with the biscuit crumbs.72
Textural Appeal
Despite its simplicity, Serradura is noteworthy for its mouthfeel. The "sawdust" layers are dry and crisp, while the cream is airy and sweet. As it sits, the crumbs hydrate slightly, but the goal is to serve it while the contrast remains. It is a "pudding" that requires no heat, relying on mechanical aeration (whipping) and the fat content of the cream for structure.
