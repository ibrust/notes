The Strawberry Basil Variation
A standout example is his Strawberry Basil Tart. The addition of basil (often as a pesto or infused in the ganache) introduces an herbaceous note that amplifies the strawberries' natural floral qualities.36 This moves the tart from "confectionery" to "gastronomy."
Why it is Noteworthy: It represents the modern shift away from sugar and towards "naturality." It requires perfect seasonal produce; you cannot hide bad fruit in a Grolet tart.
