6. Paneer Tikka (Oven-Roasted Indian Cheese)
Paneer is a fresh, acid-set cheese common in South Asian cuisine. Unlike rennet-set cheeses, paneer is coagulated using lemon juice or vinegar and heat. This process eliminates the calcium phosphate bridges that allow melting, resulting in a cheese that stays firm even at tandoor (clay oven) temperatures (500°F+).
The Marinade Chemistry
Paneer is dense and mild. To impart flavor, a thick marinade is required.
The Base: Full-fat Greek yogurt or hung curd (yogurt with whey drained). This provides a thick coating that sticks to the cheese.
The Spices: Turmeric, cumin, coriander, garam masala, and Kashmiri chili powder. These spices are fat-soluble; mixing them into the yogurt (which contains milk fat) and adding a tablespoon of oil (traditional mustard oil or ghee) ensures the flavor compounds are fully activated.25
The Acid: Lemon juice or amchur (dried mango powder) is added to tenderize the surface of the paneer and add tang.
Cooking Technique:
The paneer is cut into large cubes and tossed in the marinade along with chunks of bell pepper and onion. It is threaded onto skewers or placed on a wire rack.
Roasting: The assembly is baked at a high temperature (450°F/230°C) or broiled. The high heat chars the yogurt marinade, creating a smoky, flavorful crust similar to grilled meat. The vegetables roast alongside, softening and sweetening slightly.27
Metabolic Impact:
The spices used in Paneer Tikka are not just for flavor. Turmeric (curcumin) is a potent anti-inflammatory. Cumin and coriander are digestive aids that stimulate enzyme secretion. For a vegetarian consuming high amounts of dairy, these spices help mitigate digestive sluggishness. This dish serves as a robust, protein-heavy main course.29
