Sausage Stuffed Zucchini Boats
Zucchini is a high-water vegetable with a mild flavor and soft structure. By hollowing it out, it becomes a vessel or "boat" for proteins and fats. This preparation avoids the need for bread or buns.26
Structural Integrity
The challenge with zucchini is that it releases water when cooked, leading to a soggy dish. Pre-salting the boats or choosing a high-heat roasting method can mitigate this. The filling—sausage—releases fat which flavors the zucchini from the inside out.27
Preparation Methodology
Ingredients:
4 medium Zucchini.
1 lb Italian Sausage (bulk, mild or spicy).
1/2 cup Marinara Sauce (no sugar added).
1/2 cup Mozzarella Cheese (shredded).
1/4 cup Parmesan.
1/2 Onion, diced.
2 cloves Garlic.
Procedure:
Excavation: The zucchini are halved lengthwise. A teaspoon is used to scoop out the seeds and center flesh, leaving a 1/4-inch thick shell. The scooped flesh is chopped—do not discard it.28
Filling Synthesis: The sausage is browned in a skillet. The onions, garlic, and chopped zucchini flesh are added. The zucchini flesh cooks down and disappears into the meat, adding bulk and moisture to the filling without sogginess.29
Binding: The marinara sauce is stirred into the meat mixture to bind it slightly.
Stuffing and Baking: The raw zucchini shells are placed in a baking dish. They are mounded high with the sausage mixture.
The Melt: Baked at 400°F (205°C) for 20–25 minutes. The zucchini should be tender-crisp (al dente), not mushy. Top with mozzarella in the last 10 minutes to melt.26
