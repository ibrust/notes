TEXAS NO-BEAN CHILI, KETO COMPLIANT - DONE
===================================================

traditionally, no-bean chili uses corn flour for thickening, & large amounts of caramelized onions as aromatics.
    we can't use either of these because they contain high amounts of carbs. 

The lack of fillters in this no-bean chili mean it's even more critical to use high-quality ingredients. 

The choice of meat is the most critical thing. We'll use beef chuck, which is rich in collagen and intramuscular fat. 
    Lean cuts like sirloin dry out when simmered. 
    When cooked, chuck undergoes a transformation. 
    
        120-130F: The muscle fibers begin to denature and shrink. Myosin coagulates, and the meat changes from raw to rare
        140-150F: The collagen sheath surrounding the muscle fibers begins to shrink, exerting pressure on the cells 
            and squeezing out intracellular water. If the meat is held here, it becomes tough and dry.
        160-180F: Collagen hydrolysis begins but is kinetically slow. 
            A chuck roast might require 24 to 48 hours in this range to become tender. 
            This is the "stall" often referred to in barbecue. 
        180-200F: This is the target range. Here kinetic energy is sufficient to unwind the collagen triple helix. 
            The gelatin formed dissolves into the extracellular space, lubricating the muscle fibers 
            and providing the sensation of "moistness" even though the fibers themselves have lost water.
        212F: The high heat causes the muscle fibers to super-contract and harden, leading to a dry texture 
            despite the presence of liquid. Furthermore, boiling emulsifies the rendered fat into the sauce, 
            creating a greasy, opaque suspension.

        Many culinary experts suggest that chuck roast needs to reach an internal temperature of 190-210F to be tender.
        Our goal is a 3-4 hour simmer between 180-200F. 

    With a standard fluid like water, temperature gradients between the bottom of the pot and the rest are transient. 
        But a chili is thick enough to counteract the forces that would normally drive convection.
        Heat transfer shifts from efficient convection to inefficient conduction.
            And organic compounds (meat, sauce, vegetables) / water are relatively poor thermal conductors.
        So the heat at the bottom of the pot builds up while the rest of the pot remains cooler.
            This can make it impossible to keep the entire pot in the target window of 180-200F. 

        The dutch oven is the traditional pot used for braising, but its properties are often not understood. 
            It doesn't conduct heat well, it retains it well. 
            Energy applied to the bottom won't migrate to the sides of the pot quickly, and the chili won't cook evently.

        Fully clad triple-ply stainless steel pots will conduct the heat better, but they don't fully solve the problem.
            Their thermal conductivity is ~237 W/mK 

        The ideal pot will be a heavy-gauge copper one. 
            Their thermal conductivity is ~401 W/mK, the highest there is. 
            A heavy copper pot (2.5mm thickness) conducts heat so efficiently that the thermal energy travels up the sidewalls
            almost as effectively as it travels across the bottom. The sides of the pot effectively become heating elements.

        A wide, shallow pot is also preferred to a tall thin one, assuming the burner fits it. 
            The heat from the burner won't have to travel as far to reach the rest of the soup. 
        
    Problems with heat distribution are more prominent on the stove-top then in the oven, where heat is omnidirectional.

        Air transfers heat less efficiently than metal and liquid. 
        The viscosity of the chili will still impede convective heat transfer within the pot. 
        We'll need to determine the precise equilibrium where energy input from the oven balances the energy loss via evaporation
            to sustain the chili in the target 180-200F range. 

        If you're using a convection oven the correct oven temperature may be ~25F lower than a standard oven. 

        The perfect simmer in an oven is non-intuitive. 
        A set temperature of 250F does not equate to a food temperature of 250F, nor does it guarantee a boil.

        If one places a tightly sealed pot in an oven set to 300F, the contents of the pot will eventually 
            reach thermal equilibrium with the oven air. 
        The liquid in the pot will boil. It will remain at 212F until all the water has vaporized, 
            after which the temperature of the desiccated solids will rise to 300F.
        Standard cookbook instructions often recommend 325F or 350F for braising.
            But research indicates these temperatures invariably lead to a boil inside a covered pot.
        To maintain 180-200F we must leverage evaporative cooling. 

        - In a sealed pot: 
            Relative humidity is 100%. Evaporation stops. Temperature rises to oven temp, capped at 212F

        - In an open pot: 
            Evaporation is maximized. The liquid temperature will stabilize ~20-40F below the oven temperature.
            However, the rate of liquid loss is high, leading to drying and scorching of exposed meat.

        - When the lid is left slightly ajar: 
            This allows just enough evaporation to depress the liquid temperature below the boiling point, 
            preventing the pressure cooker effect while retaining enough moisture to keep the meat submerged.

        Empirical data and expert consensus point to 250F as the optimal oven setting for equilibrium (non-convection).

        In an oven set to 250F the ambient temperature is vastly lower than a gas flame (which can be 3000F).
            It is impossible to scorch the bottom of a pot in a 250F oven unless the liquid completely evaporates.

    
        Because Chili does not support convection (due to its thickness) the surface layer of the chili,
            exposed to the dry oven air vai the cracked lid, will undergo rapid evaporation. 
            The proteins will coagulate and polymerize, forming a tough, dark skin on the top. 
            Stirring this back into the chili introduces tough, unpleasant particles that ruin the texture. 
            Discarding it wastes volume. 

        To solve this we'll use a cartouche in conjunction with the lid left ajar. 
            A cartouche is a lid made of parchment paper that's directly in contact with the liquid. 
            It traps a thin layer of steam against the surface of the meat, keeping it hydrated. 
            It also allows for a controlled rate of evaporation based on the size of the hole. 

        Be aware that the temperature of the chili may seem to stall at around 160-170F for a period. 
            This is similar to the stall observed in BBQ brisket. 
            As the collagen breaks down and releases water, and as the muscle fibers contract and squeeze out water, 
            the evaporative load increases, cooling the pot. 
            Do not increase the oven temperature if this happens, provided the meat is cooking. 
            The temperature will creep up to 180F as the surface moisture reduces.

        

    gelatin serves two purposes in our recipe: 
        1) it coats the muscle fibers, making t heir meat seem juicy even after hours of cooking 
        2) the dissolved gelatin thickens the cooking liquid naturally. 
            in the absence of corn flour, this collagen-derived gelatin is the primary thickening agent. 

To ensure the sauce has enough body, 30% of the beef will be ground or minced. 
    These smaller beef particles will break down almost completely during the braise, 
        releasing their proteins and fats into the sauce, acting as a binder and intensifying the meaty flavor.
    You can pulse the meat in a food processor for this, or mince it by hand. 
The other 70% will be cut into 1/2 to 3/4 inch cubes. 
    
Instead of store-bought chili powder we'll make our chili paste own from whole dried chilies. 
    This allows us to control the flavor balance along 3 dimensions - sweetness, savoriness, and heat. 

    We'll use a blend of dried peppers, toasted and rehydrated. This replicates the complexity of a mole sauce. 

    Before hydration, the dried chilies will be toasted to release their oils. 
        They'll be heated on a pan (350-400F) for 15-30 seconds per side. 
        Just ensure they don't get burnt, since they become acrid and bitter instantly. 

Traditionally, onions and tomatoes provide sweetness and glutamate. 
    In our keto recipe, where onion usage is limited to suppress carb count, we must get umami from other sources. 
    We'll use a blend of umami ingredients that work synergistically: 
        1) fish sauce - rich in inosinates. synergizes with the glutamates in beef to amplify the beef flavor
        2) soy sauce - provides fermented depth and salt complexity 
        3) marmite (yeast extract) - a dense source of glutamic acid. provides a savory bottom anchoring for the spices 
        4) unsweetened cocoa powder - echoes the flavor of ancho and pasilla peppers. 
            they provide a roasted bitterness that creates the illusion of richess found in moles. 

corn flour (masa harina) is 75% carbs, and is traditionally used as a thickener in this recipe. 
    we'll use a combination of gelatin and xanthan gum (in minute quantities) to thicken the soup. 
        this is our most significant deviation from the traditional recipe.
    in addition to the gelatin we get from the braise, we'll also supplement with some unflavored beef gelatin. 


We employ a novel method when cooking the minced portion of the ground beef. 

    When ground beef is first added to a pot, then stirred or broken up, max surface area is exposed to the heat source. 
        Ground beef has a higher surface area than other meats. 
    When the beef was originally ground the cells were disrupted, which caused the release of water and myoglobin. 
        This water pools at the bottom of the pot. 
        It makes the meat turns grey without developing a crust. 

    So to cook the ground beef we'll compress it into a single, cohesive patty that covers the bottom of the dutch oven.
        This reduces the surface area of the meat, minimizing evaporation and the cooling that results.
            Only the top of the patty is exposed to air. 
            The bottom surface is in direct contact with the pan.
            The interior moisture remains trapped within the protein matrix, unable to evaporate.
        The direct contact between the meat and the cast iron (which should be preheated to 400F) 
            allows the meat surface temperature to rise rapidly above the Maillard threshold 
            before internal moisture can migrate to the surface to quench it.
        The uninterrupted contact also allows proteins to adhere to the pot bottom, 
            creating a fond that is essential for later deglazing w/ fish sauce and broth. 

Dry brining is when you salt the surface of meat and allow it to rest in the refridgerator for a prolonged time. 
This will cause a series of chemical reactions to take place:
    1) 0-30 minutes - salt crystals on the meats surface create a hypertonic environment. 
        Osmotic pressure draws water out of the muscle cells to the surface. The meat looks wet. 
    2) 30-60 minutes - the drawn-out water dissolves the salt, creating a highly concentrated brine on the surface. 
    3) 1-24 hours - teh diffusion gradient reverses. The meat's muscle fibers absorb the salty brine back into the tissue. 
        Once inside, the chloride ions interact with the electrostatic charges on the protein filaments (actin and myosin). 
        They cause the filaments to repel each other, creating larger gaps that can hold water. 
        The proteins effectively loosen and denature, trapping moisture so it can't be squeezed out as easily during cooking.

Chili is scientifically proven to taste better the next day. 
    This occurs because the gelatin sets, and the volatile aromatic compounds diffuse into the fat molecules, 
    creating a more unified flavor.

===================================================
PREPARATION 
===================================================

1) dry brine the beef the day before 
    a) cut the meat along the major fat lines, and remove the hard fat and silverskins.
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlyFB979hEs
    b) cut all of the chuck roast into 1/2-3/4 inch cubes.
         make sure to cut them small enough so that they can fit in the pot efficiently
    c) weigh out 1.5 lbs of the beef to become mince later. 
        leave it unsalted.
        just put it in the refridgerator.
    d) weigh out 3.25 lbs of meat to keep as cubes. discard the rest or use for something else
    e) toss the 3.25 lbs with 1.625 tsp of morton's salt or fine table salt (if using flakey salt you need double that)
    e) put in the refridgerator for 5-24 hours (but no longer)

2) finish preparing the beef / bacon
    a) pulse the beef saved for mince in a food processor until it looks like ground beef
    b) put the mince back in the refridgerator while you prepare the chili paste 
    c) dice the bacon 

3) prepare the chili paste 
    a) cut off the stems of the chilies, slice them lengthwise, and deseed them / discard the seeds:  
        6 dried ancho chilies
        3 dried guajillo chilies
        3 dried pasilla chilies,
        1-2 dried chipotle meco chilies
        2 dried chilies de arbol
    b) heat a dry cast iron skillet to 350-375F
    c) toast the chilies for 15-30 seconds on each side. make sure not to burn
    d) place some of the toasted chili skins in a bowl. 
        Don't include the meco chilies, but put everything else in. 
    e) pour 2 cups of 190F beef bone broth into the bowl 
        use a small plate or dish to weigh them down so that they remain submerged 
        cover with plastic and let them soak for 20-30 minutes 
        you aren't maintaining the heat, since this will degrade the flavor chemicals
    f) do the same thing for the meco chilies in another bowl, but with 1 cup of 190F water 
    g) pour the soaking beef bone broth and all the chilies (including meco) into a blender. 
        discard the water the meco soaked in
    h) add the following into the blender: 
        i) unsweetened cocoa powder, 1 tbsp 
        ii) espresso powder, very finely ground, 1 tsp
    i) blend on high for at least 2 minutes until perfectly smooth. 

4) prepare the vegetables / spices 
    a) dice the onion 
    b) mince the garlic 
    c) deseed & cut up the jalepeno 
    d) measure out the spices: 
        - whole cumin seeds, 4 tbsp 
        - dried mexican oregano, 2 tbsp 
        - ground cloves, 1/2 tsp 
        - smoked paprika, 1 tbsp 
        - ground coriander, 1 tsp 
        - ground allspice, 1/2 tsp 
        - ceylon cinnamon, 1/2 tsp 

5) brown the meat 
    a) in a cast iron pan, cook the diced bacon over medium-low heat until crisp and all fat renders
    b) remove the bacon and save it for later as a garnish 
    c) you should have about 3-4 tbsp of fat in the pan. if not, add tallow or oil 
    d) heat the pan to between 400-450F (I put our burner on ~5-6)
    e) sear the cubed beef 
        i) take the cubed beef out of the refridgerator (it goes straight from the fridge to the pan to avoid condensation) 
        ii) sear it in batches so the pan isn't crowded. no pieces should touch
        iii) sear for 2-3 minutes per side
        iv) remove it to a bowl when done 
    f) cook the minced beef 
        i) take the mince out of the fridge 
        ii) on a sheet of parchment paper, press the meat into a disk slightly smaller than the diameter of the pan
        iii) invert the paper to drop the patty into the pan
        iv) let it cook undisturbed for 4-5 minutes until a dark crust forms 
        v) break the meat up & cook it for about 2-3 minutes. 
            we want to break it up so it doesn't cook at 1 large mass, since it needs to dissolve
        vii) remove to a bowl 

6) cook the vegetables 
    a) reduce heat to medium
    b) add more tallow/oil to the pan if it's dry
    c) add the onions and fresh jalepeno
    d) saute for 8-10 minutes until soft and golden 
    e) add the garlic & cook for 1 minute until fragrant 

7) add spices, tomatoes, & flavors 
    a) add the following spices: 
        - whole cumin seeds, 4 tbsp 
        - dried mexican oregano, 2 tbsp 
        - ground cloves, 1/2 tsp 
        - smoked paprika, 1 tbsp 
        - ground coriander, 1 tsp 
        - ground allspice, 1/2 tsp 
        - ceylon cinnamon, 1/2 tsp 
    b) stir constantly for 60 seconds. 
        the spices must fry in the oil to release fat-soluble flavor compounds. 
    c) add the tomato paste, 1/4 cup
    d) stir and cook for 2-3 minutes 
        the paste should darken from bright red to rust-colored 
        this caramelization creates umami and reduces acidity 
    e) pour in the following: 
        - fish sauce, 1 tbsp  
        - tamari, 1 tbsp 
        - marmite, 1 tsp (yeast extract) 
    f) scrape the bottom of the pan vigorously with a wooden spatula to dissolve the fond on the bottom 


8) add the ingredients & bring them up to temperature

    a) transfer the mixture to a stainless steel triple-ply pot (if simmering on stovetop) or a dutch oven (if using oven)
    b) return all beef (and any accumulated juices from the bowl) to the pot 
    c) pour in the chili paste from the blender 
    d) pour in the remaining 2 cups of beef bone broth (you started with 4 cups, used 2 on the chilies)
            Ensure the liquid covers the meat cubes. This is critical for tenderization. 
            If it doesn't, you'll have to adjust the amounts later. 
            Meanwhile try adding a little water. 

9) simmer the chili (either on a stovetop or in the oven) 

    - if cooking in the oven: 
        a) preheat the oven to 240-255F (try different temperatures and adjust until the target range is maintained) 
        b) bring the mixture to a ~190F simmer (but not a boil)
            we do this because air is a poor heat conductor. it would take too long for the chili to get hot ifput it in the oven without simmering first
        c) arrange racks so the chili will sit on the lower-middle position (not at the very bottom) 
        d) construct a cartouche: 
            i) tear off a piece of parchment paper slightly larger than the pots diameter 
            ii) fold it into a triangle and trim the edge to match the radius of the pot 
            iii) snip the tip to create a ~1 inch vent hole 
        e) once simmering, apply the cartouche 
            i) remove the pot from the heat 
            ii) carefully lay the parchment paper circle directly onto the surface of the chili. 
            iii) press it down gently with a spoon so it is wetted by the liquid and makes full contact.
        f) place the lid on top, leaving it slightly ajar 
        g) put the pot in the oven for 3 to 4 hours
        h) monitor the temperature periodically

    - if cooking on a burner:
        a) bring the mixture to a boil
        b) immediately reduce heat to low (~1.5 with the lid on was about right for our burners) 
                the goal is a temperature 180-200F 
        c) cover the pot, leaving the lid slightly ajar to allow for evaporation and temperature regulation 
        d) simmer for 3 to 4 hours
            at 2 hours, taste for salt. the meat should be starting to soften. 
            You might need to periodically stir it to maintain temperature regulation. 
            If so, when temps reach ~195-200F, stir the pot. 
            keep the lid on otherwise (it regulates temperature).

9) keto thickening / reduction phase 
    a) remove the lid. if you cooked in an oven, remove the cartouche & transfer back to the stovetop 
    b) check that the meat is tender (it should yield easily to a fork) 
    c) while the chili finishes, sprinkle the 2.5 tsp gelatin over 2 tbsp of cold water in a small cup 
    d) let it sit for 5 minutes until it becomes a solid rubbery puck 
    e) stir the bloomed gelatin into the hot chili. it will dissolve instantly 
    f) in a small bowl, whisk the 1/2 tsp xantham gum into 1 tbsp olive oil until smooth 
    g) pour this oil-gum mixture into the chili while stirring. 
        never add xanthan powder directly to hot liquid, it will clump instantly 
    h) simmer for an additional 15 minutes. 
        the sauce will tighten up significantly as the hydrocolloids hydrate and water evaporates 

10) finishing 
    a) turn off the heat 
    b) stir in the 1 tbsp apple cider vinegar
        the acid wakes up the heavy flavors and cuts through fat 
    c) season to taste 
        i) if it's too bitter, add a pinch of salt or a tiny amount (1/2 tsp) of liquid sweetener (monk fruit / stevia) 
        ii) if it's too mild, add a pinch of cayenne 
        iii) if it's too acidic, stir in 1/4 tsp baking soda 
    d) add shredded aged cheddar / cilantro to taste 
    e) add the bacon bits
