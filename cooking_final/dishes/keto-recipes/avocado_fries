7.2 Parmesan Crusted Avocado Fries
Heating avocado is unconventional, but effective. The fats soften, and with a crisp coating, it mimics the texture of a french fry or mozzarella stick.58
Methodology
Ingredients:
2 Firm-Ripe Avocados.
1/2 cup Grated Parmesan Cheese.
1/2 cup Pork Rind Crumbs (Pork Panko) - optional, for extra crunch, or just use Parm.
Egg wash.
Procedure:
Slicing: Slice avocados into wedges.
Breading: Dip in egg, then press into the Parmesan/Pork Rind mixture. The cheese melts and crisps (the "frico" effect).59
Cooking: Air fry at 400°F for 7-10 minutes.
Result: A crispy, salty exterior with a warm, creamy interior. High fat, very low carb.
