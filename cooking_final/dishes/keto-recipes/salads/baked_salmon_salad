Baked Salmon Salad (Fresh Preparation)
While canned salmon is a convenient pantry staple, using freshly baked salmon elevates the dish by retaining moisture and providing a flakier, less compressed texture. This salad serves as a primary source of Vitamin D and selenium.
4.3.1 Culinary Method: Baking for Salad
The salmon should be baked at 400°F (204°C) until it reaches an internal temperature of 135-140°F. Baking with a light brush of olive oil ensures the fish remains moist after cooling. It is imperative to let the salmon cool to room temperature before mixing to prevent the mayonnaise-based dressing from splitting due to heat.14
Execution Protocol:
The Fish: Season 1 lb of salmon fillets with salt and pepper. Bake until flaky. Cool and flake into large chunks.
The Crunch: Combine with 1/4 cup diced red bell pepper, 1/4 cup diced red onion, and 1/2 cup diced cucumber. The red pepper adds Vitamin C and a touch of sweetness.
The Dressing: Whisk 1/2 cup mayonnaise, 1 tbsp lemon juice, 1 tsp Dijon mustard, 1 tbsp fresh chopped dill, and 1/2 tsp smoked paprika. The smoked paprika mimics the flavor profile of cold-smoked salmon.
Assembly: Gently fold the salmon and vegetables with the dressing. Refrigerate for 20 minutes before serving to firm up the fats.
