Greek Salad (Horiatiki)
Traditional Greek salad is naturally close to keto standards, but the onion and tomato content can add up in carbohydrates. This version optimizes ratios to keep carbs low while maximizing flavor intensity through Feta and olives.
5.2.1 Sourcing: The Importance of Feta
The choice of Feta is critical. Consumers should buy block feta in brine, not pre-crumbled varieties. Pre-crumbled cheese often contains anti-caking agents (cellulose powder) which can add trace carbs, and the cheese is usually drier. Block feta retains moisture and has a superior, creamier texture. Sheep's milk feta offers a more authentic, tangy flavor profile than cow's milk versions.
Execution Protocol:
Vegetable Prep: Slice 1 cucumber, deseed and dice 1 red and 1 green pepper (green peppers are lower in sugar than red), and thinly slice 1/2 red onion.
Cheese: Dice 4 oz feta cheese into cubes.
Assembly: Combine vegetables, cheese, and 1/2 cup pitted Kalamata olives.
Dressing: Unlike the mayo-based salads, this uses a vinaigrette. Mix 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil, 1 tbsp red wine vinegar, 1 tsp dried oregano, salt, and pepper.
Serve: Immediate service is recommended to prevent the vegetables from weeping water due to the osmotic pressure of the salt.15
