4.4.1 Ingredient Analysis
Arugula (Rocket): Contains high levels of dietary nitrates, which can improve blood flow and lower blood pressure. Its bitterness stimulates digestive enzyme production, aiding in fat breakdown.
Smoked Salmon: A dense source of sodium, often depleted in ketosis.
Execution Protocol:
Base: Place 6 oz arugula in a large salad bowl.
Lipid Layers: Add 1 diced medium avocado and 7 oz smoked salmon slices.
Textural Contrast: Sprinkle with 1 tsp sesame seeds and 2 tbsp sunflower seeds. These seeds add magnesium, a critical electrolyte.
