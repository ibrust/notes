The Aeration Technique
To achieve the loft of a buttermilk pancake without gluten, mechanical aeration is required.
Separated Eggs: The yolks are mixed with the almond flour, liquid, and fat. The egg whites are whipped separately to soft peaks and gently folded into the batter. The air trapped in the protein foam provides lift that baking powder alone cannot achieve in heavy nut flour.42
Cooking Dynamics: Almond flour burns at lower temperatures. Pancakes must be cooked on medium-low heat to allow the heat to penetrate the center and set the egg structure before the exterior carbonizes. Flipping requires care as the batter is more fragile than wheat batter until fully set
