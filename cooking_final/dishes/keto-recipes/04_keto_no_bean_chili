TEXAS NO-BEAN CHILI, KETO COMPLIANT - DONE
===================================================

traditionally, no-bean chili uses corn flour for thickening, & large amounts of caramelized onions as aromatics.
    we can't use either of these because they contain high amounts of carbs. 

The lack of fillters in this no-bean chili mean it's even more critical to use high-quality ingredients. 

The choice of meat is the most critical thing. We'll use beef chuck, which is rich in collagen and intramuscular fat. 
    Lean cuts like sirloin dry out when simmered. 
    chuk undergoes a transformation. As the meat is held between 160-180F, the triple-helix structure of the collagen 
        begins to unwind and hydrolyze into gelatin. 

    gelatin serves two purposes in our recipe: 
        1) it coats the muscle fibers, making t heir meat seem juicy even after hours of cooking 
        2) the dissolved gelatin thickens the cooking liquid naturally. 
            in the absence of corn flour, this collagen-derived gelatin is the primary thickening agent. 

To ensure the sauce has enough body, 30% of the beef will be ground or minced. 
    These smaller beef particles will break down almost completely during the braise, 
        releasing their proteins and fats into the sauce, acting as a binder and intensifying the meaty flavor.
    You can pulse the meat in a food processor for this, or mince it by hand. 
The other 70% will be cut into 1/2 to 3/4 inch cubes. 
    
Instead of store-bought chili powder we'll make our chili paste own from whole dried chilies. 
    This allows us to control the flavor balance along 3 dimensions - sweetness, savoriness, and heat. 

    We'll use a blend of dried peppers, toasted and rehydrated. This replicates the complexity of a mole sauce. 

    Before hydration, the dried chilies will be toasted to release their oils. 
        They'll be heated on a pan (350-400F) for 15-30 seconds per side. 
        Just ensure they don't get burnt, since they become acrid and bitter instantly. 

Traditionally, onions and tomatoes provide sweetness and glutamate. 
    In our keto recipe, where onion usage is limited to suppress carb count, we must get umami from other sources. 
    We'll use a blend of umami ingredients that work synergistically: 
        1) fish sauce - rich in inosinates. synergizes with the glutamates in beef to amplify the beef flavor
        2) soy sauce - provides fermented depth and salt complexity 
        3) marmite (yeast extract) - a dense source of glutamic acid. provides a savory bottom anchoring for the spices 
        4) unsweetened cocoa powder - echoes the flavor of ancho and pasilla peppers. 
            they provide a roasted bitterness that creates the illusion of richess found in moles. 

corn flour (masa harina) is 75% carbs, and is traditionally used as a thickener in this recipe. 
    we'll use a combination of gelatin and xanthan gum (in minute quantities) to thicken the soup. 
        this is our most significant deviation from the traditional recipe.
    in addition to the gelatin we get from the braise, we'll also supplement with some unflavored beef gelatin. 


Chili is scientifically proven to taste better the next day. 
    This occurs because the gelatin sets, and the volatile aromatic compounds diffuse into the fat molecules, 
    creating a more unified flavor.

===================================================
PREPARATION 
===================================================

1) prepare the meat 
    a) cut 3.5 lbs of the chuk roast into 1/2 to 3/4 inch cubes 
    b) take the remaining 1.5 lbs and mince or pulse it in a food processor until it resembles coarse ground beef 
    c) toss all the beef with 1 tbsp salt 
    d) let all the beef sit on a wire rack for 45 minutes while you prepare the chili paste
        this draws out moisture and denatures surface proteins, facilitating a better sear. 
    e) dice the bacon 

2) prepare the chili paste 
    a) cut off the stems of the chilies, slice them lengthwise, and deseed them / discard the seeds:  
        6 dried ancho chilies
        3 dried guajillo chilies
        3 dried pasilla chilies,
        1-2 dried chipotle meco chilies
        2 dried chilies de arbol
    b) heat a dry cast iron skillet over medium-high (375F) 
    c) toast the chilies for 15-30 seconds on each side. make sure not to burn
    d) place some of the toasted chili skins in a bowl. 
        Don't include the meco chilies, but put everything else in. 
    e) pour 2 cups of 190F beef bone broth into the bowl 
        use a small plate or dish to weigh them down so that they remain submerged 
        cover with plastic and let them soak for 20-30 minutes 
        you aren't maintaining the heat, since this will degrade the flavor chemicals
    f) do the same thing for the meco chilies in another bowl, but with 1 cup of 190F water 
    g) pour the soaking beef bone broth and all the chilies (including meco) into a blender. 
        discard the water the meco soaked in
    h) add the following into the blender: 
        i) unsweetened cocoa powder, 1 tbsp 
        ii) espresso powder, very finely ground, 1 tsp
    i) blend on high for at least 2 minutes until perfectly smooth. 


3) brown the meat 
    a) in a dutch oven, cook the diced bacon over medium-low heat until crisp and all fat renders
    b) remove the bacon and save it for later as a garnish 
    c) you should have about 3-4 tbsp of fat in the pot. if not, add tallow or oil 
    d) turn heat to high 
    e) sear the cubed beef 
        i) sear it in batches so the pan isn't crowded. no pieces should touch
        ii) sear for 2-3 minutes per side
        iii) remove it to a bowl when done 
    f) cook the ground beef 
        i) put the ground beef in the dutch oven (keep it on high)
        ii) press it into a large patty covering the bottom of the pot 
        iii) let it cook undisturbed for 4-5 minutes until a dark crust forms (like a smash burger) 
        iv) break it up and brown the rest of the meat, probably 2-3 minutes
        v) remove to a bowl 


4) cook the vegetables 
    a) reduce heat to medium
    b) add more tallow/oil to the pot if it's dry
    c) add the onions and fresh jalepeno
    d) saute for 8-10 minutes until soft and golden 
    e) add the minced garlic & cook for 1 minute until fragrant 


5) add spices, tomatoes, & flavors 
    a) add the following spices: 
        - whole cumin seeds, 4 tbsp 
        - dried mexican oregano, 2 tbsp 
        - ground cloves, 1/2 tsp 
        - smoked paprika, 1 tbsp 
        - ground coriander, 1 tsp 
        - ground allspice, 1/2 tsp 
        - ceylon cinnamon, 1/2 tsp 
    b) stir constantly for 60 seconds. 
        the spices must fry in the oil to release fat-soluble flavor compounds. 
    c) add the tomato paste, 1/4 cup
    d) stir and cook for 2-3 minutes 
        the paste should darken from bright red to rust-colored 
        this caramelization creates umami and reduces acidity 
    e) pour in the following: 
        - fish sauce, 1 tbsp  
        - tamari, 1 tbsp 
        - marmite, 1 tsp (yeast extract) 
    f) scrape the bottom of the pot vigorously with a wooden spatula to dissolve the fond on the bottom 


6) cook at simmer 
    a) return all beef (and any accumulated juices from the bowl) to the pot 
    b) pour in the chili paste from the blender 
    c) pour in the remaining 2 cups of beef bone broth (you started with 4 cups, used 2 on the chilies)
    d) bring the mixture to a boil
    f) immediately reduce heat to the lowest setting. 
        the goal is a temperature 180-190F 
    g) cover the pot, leaving the lid slightly ajar to allow for evaporation and temperature regulation 
    h) simmer for 3 to 3.5 hours 
        at 2 hours, taste for salt. the meat should be starting to soften 


7) keto thickening
    a) check that the meat is tender (it should yield easily to a fork) 
    b) while the chili finishes, sprinkle the gelatin over 2 tbsp of cold water in a small cup 
    c) let it sit for 5 minutes until it becomes a solid rubbery puck 
    d) stir the bloomed gelatin into the hot chili. it will dissolve instantly 
    e) in a small bowl, whisk the 1/2 tsp xantham gum into 1 tbsp olive oil until smooth 
    f) pour this oil-gum mixture into the chili while stirring. 
        never add xanthan powder directly to hot liquid, it will clump instantly 
    g) remove the lid entirely & simmer for an additional 20 minutes. 
        the sauce will tighten up significantly as the hydrocolloids hydrate and water evaporates 
    

8) finishing 
    a) turn off the heat 
    b) stir in the apple cider vinegar
        the acid wakes up the heavy flavors and cuts through fat 
    c) season to taste 
        i) if it's too bitter, add a pinch of salt or a tiny amount (1/2 tsp) of liquid sweetener (monk fruit / stevia) 
        ii) if it's too mild, add a pinch of cayenne 
        iii) if it's too acidic, stir in 1/4 tsp baking soda 
    d) add shredded aged cheddar / cilantro to taste 
    e) add the bacon bits
