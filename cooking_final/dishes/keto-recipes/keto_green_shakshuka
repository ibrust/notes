12. Green Shakshuka
Traditional Shakshuka poaches eggs in a tomato-pepper sauce. While delicious, tomatoes and onions can be higher in carbohydrates. Green Shakshuka utilizes leafy greens and cream to create a lower-carb, micronutrient-dense poaching liquid.
The Chemistry of Creamed Greens
Leafy greens like spinach, kale, and chard contain oxalates and can be astringent. Cooking them with fat (calcium-rich cream or cheese) helps bind the oxalates, potentially reducing their absorption, and mitigates the astringency.
The Base Construction:
Greens: A massive volume of spinach and kale is wilted down in butter or ghee.
Liquid: Heavy cream, coconut milk, or a small amount of vegetable broth is added to create a sauce.
Spices: Cumin, coriander, and fresh jalapeño provide the flavor backbone.51
The Poach:
Wells are made in the green mixture, and eggs are cracked in. The pan is covered. The steam trapped by the lid cooks the tops of the eggs (basting them in steam), while the bottoms poach in the creamy liquid.
Finishing: Crumbled feta or goat cheese is added. The saltiness of the cheese cuts the richness of the cream and egg yolk.53 This dish provides a massive dose of Vitamin K, Vitamin A, and magnesium.
