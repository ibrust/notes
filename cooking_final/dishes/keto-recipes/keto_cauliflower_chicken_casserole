Creamy Buffalo Chicken Casserole
While casseroles often rely on condensed soups (processed food) and breadcrumbs, this version builds a béchamel-like structure using cauliflower cream and nutritional yeast. It satisfies the craving for "gooey" comfort food.
Cauliflower as a Starch Mimic
Cauliflower is unique in its high pectin content. When pureed or cooked down, it creates a creamy mouthfeel. In this recipe, riced cauliflower acts as the bulk agent, absorbing the fat and sauce, mimicking rice or pasta.

Culinary Methodology: Moisture Management
Detailed Execution:
Moisture Removal: The critical step is removing water from the cauliflower rice. If using frozen, thaw it and wring it out aggressively in a clean tea towel. If using fresh, sauté it in a dry pan to evaporate moisture. Failure to do this results in a watery, soupy casserole rather than a distinct, creamy bake.11
Sauce Emulsion: Whisk the hot sauce into the mayo (made with avocado oil, not soy) and spices.
Baking: Combine the chicken, dried cauliflower rice, and sauce. Transfer to a baking dish.
Topping: If dairy is permitted, top with cheddar cheese. If dairy-free, use a crust of crushed pork rinds mixed with nutritional yeast for texture. Bake until bubbling.
