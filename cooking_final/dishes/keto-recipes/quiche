14. Crustless Quiche Lorraine: The Savory Custard
Culinary Gap Addressed: Baked egg dishes; meal prep; custard technique.
Key Ingredient: Eggs and Heavy Cream.
The Architectural Concept
Quiche is distinct from a frittata in its dairy content. A frittata is mostly egg; a quiche is a custard (eggs suspended in liquid). By removing the crust, we focus entirely on the silkiness of the custard. This dish utilizes the coagulation of egg proteins to suspend heavy ingredients (bacon, cheese) in a delicate matrix.47
Ingredient Specifications and Sourcing
The Matrix: 4 large eggs to 1.5 cups heavy cream. This ratio ensures a silky, not rubbery, texture.47
Inclusions: Bacon (cooked crisp), Gruyère cheese (classic for Lorraine, melts well without oiling off), and sautéed onions.47
Seasoning: Nutmeg and cayenne pepper.
Thermodynamic Execution
Blind Baking (None): The mixture is poured into a well-buttered pie dish.
Moderate Heat: Baked at 350°F. High heat would cause the eggs to puff rapidly and then collapse, squeezing out water (syneresis). Moderate heat sets the custard gently.47
The Set: The quiche must cool for at least 30 minutes. It finishes setting as it cools. Cutting it hot results in a structural failure.47
Nutritional Implications
This is a perfect ratio of fat to protein for keto (roughly 1:1 in grams, which is high fat by calorie). It is excellent cold or warm.
