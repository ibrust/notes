15. Eggplant Rollatini (No Breadcrumbs)
A reimagining of lasagna that uses roasted eggplant slices as the "noodles." This dish relies on the sponge-like quality of eggplant to absorb olive oil.
Solanine and Moisture Management
Eggplant contains excessive water and can be bitter (due to solanine/saponins).
Sweating: The eggplant is sliced lengthwise, salted liberally, and left to sit for 30 minutes. Osmosis draws out the bitter water. The salt is then rinsed off and the slices patted dry.
Roasting: The slices are brushed with olive oil and roasted until pliable. This step is crucial; raw eggplant will not cook through inside the roll.61
The Filling:
A mixture of whole-milk ricotta, egg (as a binder), parmesan, and fresh herbs (basil/parsley) is prepared.
Assembly: A dollop of filling is placed on each eggplant slice, which is then rolled up.
Baking: The rolls are placed in a baking dish with a sugar-free marinara sauce (tomatoes, garlic, olive oil) and topped with mozzarella.
The Result: Baking fuses the flavors. The eggplant becomes meltingly tender, the cheese browns, and the sauce reduces. It offers the comfort of pasta without the starch.62
