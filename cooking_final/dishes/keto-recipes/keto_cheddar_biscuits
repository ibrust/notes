Cheddar Bay Biscuits (Almond Flour Drop Matrix)
For a bread option that requires neither the labor of yeast nor the complexity of Fathead dough, the almond flour drop biscuit is the optimal solution.
The "Drop" Mechanics
Unlike rolled biscuits which require a gluten network to hold shape, drop biscuits rely on a high-hydration batter held together by egg protein and baking powder lift. The batter is spooned directly onto the baking sheet.30
Lipid Infusion and Flavor
Almond flour is lipophilic (fat-loving). The signature flavor of these biscuits is achieved by brushing them after baking with a mixture of melted butter, garlic powder, and parsley. The porous almond crumb absorbs this flavored fat deeply, creating a moist mouthfeel that mimics the original Red Lobster restaurant staple.31
Leavening Ratios
To counteract the density of almond flour, the ratio of baking powder is elevated (approx. 1 tsp per cup of flour). Additionally, the cheese incorporated into the dough acts as a discontinuous phase, creating pockets of savory flavor and interrupting the dense nut flour matrix.
