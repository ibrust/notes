KETO AVOCADO FRIES - DONE
===================================================

Traditionally, the gelatinization of amylose and amylopectin (starches within potatos) give fries their rigid, crisp exterior
    while protecting a fluffy, hydrated interior.

Heating the avocado softens its fatty flesh, which mimics the soft interior texture of a fry.
But to get a crisp exterior we must coat the fry. 
    The coating must withstand heat, adhere to the fatty surface, and provide structural rigidity. 


Not all avocados are suitable for heating. 
    Hass and Florida/Hall have vastly different oil-to-water ratios. 
    Florida avocados are larger but hav emuch higher water content and oil concentration. 
        When heated, the internal water vaporizes rapidly, creating steam pressure that blows the breading off the fruit. 
        Furthermore, the lower fat content results in a flesh that becomes fibrous and watery rather than creamy. 

    The Hass avocado, characterized by its pebbly dark skin, is the preferred choice for our recipe.  
        It has a high oil content ranging from 18%-22%. 
        Upon heating, the fat softens, creating a custard-like texture. 
        The oil retains heat, allowing the interior to warm through gently without turning into soup. 


The most common failure is the collapse of the wedge during the breading or cooking process.
    As an avocado ripens, pectinase enzymes break down the pectin that glues the cell walls together, softening the flesh. 

    For the purpose of this recipe, ripe avocados that would be good in guacamole are structurally insufficient. 
        We're looking for avocados that are firm-ripe. These will retain enough cellular adhesion to hold a wedge shape during prep & cooking. 
        The fruit should yield slightly to pressure, but not indent deeply or feel detached from the skin. 

Upon slicing, the avocado flesh is exposed to oxygen, triggering the rapid activity of polyphenol oxidase, leading to enzymatic browning.
    For aesthetics we halt this reaction immediately during prep. 
    Furthermore, the surface of a sliced avocado is inherently oleophilic (oil-loving) and slippery. This presents a challenge for adhesion. 

    So the application of citric acid (found in lime or lemon juice) serves a dual function. 
        It lowers the PH of the surface, inhibiting pollyphenol oxidase and preserving the green color. 
        As the acid interacts with the surface proteins and dries slightly, 
            it creates a tacky microstructure that aids in the initial adhesion of the flour coating. 

We must engineer a crust using protein and fat matrices that harden upon cooling.
    Porcine collagen (pork rinds) and aged hard cheese (paresan) will suffice. 

Early iterations of low-carb frying relied solely on almond flour, which often results in a soft, mealy exterior. 
    The introduction of crushed pork rinds revolutionized this domain. 
    Pork rinds are skin tissue that has been dehydrated and fried. They are a matrix of collagen and fat.

    Unlike almond flour, which can absorb moisture and become soggy, pork rinds are hydrophobic and maintain their crunch 
        even in the presence of avocado moisture.

    The particle size of the pork rind is critical. 
        A fine powder creates a dense, heavy shell. 
        A course crumb creates a jagged, airy surface that increases crunch. 
        We want a coarse, panko-style grind. 

While pork rinds carry a distinct savory note, they act as an excellent carrier for spices.
    When seasoned properly, the specific pork flavor is masked, leaving only the sensation of a savory, salty crunch.

The second pillar of the crust architecture is Parmesan cheese. 
    The phenomenon at play here is the "Frico Effect". 
    When grated Parmesan (a hard, low-moisture cheese) is exposed to temperatures above 350F, the fat melts and the protein structure (casein) relaxes.
    As the water evaporates, the proteins begin to brown via the Maillard reaction and cross-link into a rigid, lacy lattice. 
    Upon cooling, this lattice hardens into a crisp wafer (frico). 

While Parmesan alone can be brittle, and pork rinds alone can be loose, combining them in a 1:1 ratio creates a composite material. 
    The melting cheese acts as a secondary glue, binding the pork rind crumbs together and adhering them to the avocado, 
    while the pork rinds provide volume and thermal insulation.

To adhere the egg wash to the fatty avocado, a dry pre-dust of almond flour is required. 


Air frying is the optimal cooking method for this application. 
    An air fryer is essentially a high-velocity convection oven.
    It works by circulating hot air around the food, stripping away the boundary layer of cool, moist air that surrounds the cooking item. 
    This promotes rapid evaporation of surface moisture, which is essential for crisping the cheese/pork rind matrix 
        before the avocado interior turns to mush.
    High heat (400F) is necessary to activate the Maillard reaction in the Parmesan cheese and to "shock" the coating into rigidity.
        Lower temperatures would require longer cooking times to achieve browning, during which the avocado would overheat and possibly liquify.

Despite the fat in the cheese and avocado, a light spray of avocado oil is required on the outside of the breaded fry.
     Air is a poor conductor of heat compared to oil. 
     The spray acts as a thermal bridge, conducting heat from the air directly into the nooks and crannies of the pork rind breading, 
        ensuring even browning rather than spotty burning.

INGREDIENTS
===================================================

for the fries: 
    2 large Hass avocados - firm-ripe (bumpy dark skin, slight yield to pressure)
    2 limes (for 1 tbsp juice) 

    2 large eggs, beaten thoroughly 
    heavy cream, 1 tbsp 
    pork panko, 3/4 cup, coarse (not fine powder - can be crushed from pork rinds) 
    parmesan cheese, 3/4 cup, grated (refrigerated type preferred over shelf-stable powder for better melting dynamics) 
    almond flour, superfine, 1/2 cup, sifted 

    smoked paprika, 1/2 tsp 
    fine sea salt, 1/2 tsp 
    garlic powder, 1/4 tsp 
    avocado oil spray (propellant-free spray preferred)

for the cajun seasoning: 
    smoked paprika, 2 tsp 
    garlic powder, 1 tsp 
    onion powder, 1 tsp 
    dried oregano, 1 tsp 
    cayenne pepper, 1/2 tsp 
    salt, 1/2 tsp 
    black pepper, 1/2 tsp 

for the sauce: 
    sour cream (full fat), 1/2 cup 
    mayonnaise, 1/4 cup (use avocado-oil may, maybe create your own) 
    2-3 chipotle peppers in adobo (canned) - finely minced
    adobo sauce, 1 tsp (from the can) 
    1 lime (for the juice) 
    cumin, 1/4 tsp 
    garlic, 1 clove, grated (or 1/2 tsp garlic powder) 

    you might also be able to buy a sauce at the store with most of these ingredients. 

===================================================
PREPARATION 
===================================================


1) make the sauce (optional) 
    a) combine all sauce ingredients in a food processor: 
        sour cream (full fat), 1/2 cup 
        mayonnaise, 1/4 cup (use avocado-oil may, maybe create your own) 
        2-3 chipotle peppers in adobo (canned) - finely minced
        adobo sauce, 1 tsp (from the can) 
        1 lime (for the juice) 
        cumin, 1/4 tsp 
        garlic, 1 clove, grated (or 1/2 tsp garlic powder) 
    b) pulse until smooth 
    c) refrigerate for at least 30 minutes before serving to allow the dehydrated spices (cumin) to hydrate and the flavors to meld 

2) in a bowl mix the cajun seasoning (I found I needed double the amount): 
    smoked paprika, 2 tsp 
    garlic powder, 1 tsp 
    onion powder, 1 tsp 
    dried oregano, 1 tsp 
    cayenne pepper, 1/2 tsp 
    salt, 1/2 tsp 
    black pepper, 1/2 tsp 

3) prepare the coating bowls 
    a) get 2 more bowls 
    b) in the first bowl mix:
        sifted almond flour, 1/2 cup 
        fine sea salt, 1/2 tsp 
        garlic powder, 1/4 tsp 
    c) in the second bowl whisk until uniform: 
        2 large eggs
        1 tbsp cream
    d) now add to the cajun seasoning bowl: 
        pork panko, 3/4 cup 
        parmesan cheese, 3/4 cup 

4) cut the avocados 
    a) squeeze 2 limes into a small bowl (1 tbsp of lime juice) 
    b) slice the avocados in half lengthwise and remove the pit 
    c) peel the skin carefully - do not use a spoon to scoop the flesh out, this creates a ragged surface that makes breading difficult 
    d) slice each half into 4 wedges. uniformity is crucial for even cooking 
    e) place the wedges on a large plate 
        drizzle immediately with lime juice. 
        turn them to coat 
        (this prevents oxidation and creates the tacky surface needed for the flour)
    f) season the wedges directly with a pinch of salt 

5) for each wedge: 
    a) roll it in bowl 1
        it should be fully coated but shake off the excess. 
        a thicker layer of flour will prevent the egg from bonding to the fruit, and the curst will slide off later
    b) dip into bowl 2
        ensure complete submersion
        lift and let excess drip off for 2-3 seconds 
    c) place in bowl 3. 
        press the crumb mixture gently but firmly into the avocado flesh. do not just roll. 
        the cheese and pork rinds need to be mechanically embedded into the surface layer of the egg wash 
    d) move to a parchment-lined baking sheet. repeat for all wedges


6) place the baking sheet in the freezer for 20-30 minutes
    this solidifies the avocado fat and the egg wash. 
    it glues the breading to the fruit before it enters the violent environment of the air fryer. 
    this should significantly reduce the failure rate of breading falling off during flipping. 

7) cook the fries 
    a) set the air fryer to 400F. allow it to heat up for 3-5 minutes
    b) remove fries from freezer 
    c) spray the air fryer basket with oil 
    d) arrange fries in a single layer with space between them. do not stack 
    e) spray the tops of the fries with avocado oil
    f) cook 4-5 minutes 
    g) open the basket, carefully flip each wedge & spray the new top with oil again 
    h) cook for another 3-5 minutes 
    i) look for a deep golden brown color. the parmesan should look toasted and rigid. 

    if baking in oven, extend time to 12-15 min at 400

8) remove the fries to a wire cooling rack (not a plate) & let them stand for 3 minutes 
    the parmesan must go back below its melting point to resolidify into the crispy shell.

TEST RESULTS / ADJUSTMENTS
===================================================

It's hard to make more than 2 avocados worth without your bowls getting soggy. 
    So, if there's ever a need, you may have to switch bowls midway through. 

Common pitfalls: 
1) breading falls off 
    - avocado had too much egg wash on it
    - flour layer too thick 
    - forgot to freeze 
2) soggy fries. exterior soft, interior mushy 
    - overcrowding (steaming) 
    - temp too low (< 375F)
    - ate too soon (cheese didn't set 
3) burning 
    - rack too close to element
    - almond flour burns quickly, you should use mainly pork rinds / parm for outer layer (less almond flour in outer mix) 
4) blandness 
    - salt only in breading, not on fruit 
    - lack of acid (forgot the lime juice)
