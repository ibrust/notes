9. Walnut Crusted Salmon
Salmon is naturally high in omega-3 fatty acids. This recipe adds additional healthy fats through walnuts, creating a caloric density ideal for keto maintenance.
Ingredient Sourcing and Chemistry
Salmon Fillets (2, 3 oz each, skin-on preferred for moisture retention). The crust is a paste made from Walnuts (1/2 cup), Sugar-Free Maple Syrup (2 tbsp), Dijon Mustard (1/2 - 1 tbsp), and Dill.16
The Sugar-Free Maple Syrup serves as the binding agent and glazing mechanism. Brands like Walden Farms or Lakanto (monk fruit based) are readily available in the baking or diabetic sections of US supermarkets. These syrups use erythritol or sucralose to mimic the viscosity of maple syrup, allowing the walnut crust to adhere and caramelize without burning.16
Culinary Technique
Searing: The salmon is first seared skin-side down in a hot pan with olive oil. This renders the subcutaneous fat and crisps the skin, providing a textural contrast to the soft meat.
Crusting and Baking: The walnut paste is applied to the raw top side. The fish is then transferred to the oven (350°F). Baking cooks the fish through while toasting the walnuts. If the walnuts were added during the initial sear, they would likely burn before the fish was cooked through.16
Flavor Profile:
Decadent and textural. The crunch of the toasted walnuts contrasts with the soft, fatty salmon. The sugar-free syrup and mustard create a "sweet and savory" glaze effect similar to honey-mustard salmon but with zero glycemic impact.16
