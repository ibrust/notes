7. Steamed Mussels in White Wine Garlic Sauce
Mussels are a high-protein, low-fat shellfish that naturally create their own broth during cooking. This recipe enriches that broth with fats to meet keto ratios.
Ingredient Sourcing and Chemistry
Live Blue Mussels (3 lbs) are the standard and are widely available in mesh bags in US seafood departments. They must be alive when cooked; this is verified by ensuring the shells are closed or close when tapped. The liquid base is Sauvignon Blanc (8 oz), Garlic (1 tsp), Butter (1 tbsp), and Parsley.12
Culinary Technique
Cleaning (Debearding): The "beard" (byssal threads) used by the mussel to attach to rocks must be removed. This is a manual process of yanking the fibers toward the hinge of the shell.
Steaming: Mussels release "liquor" (saltwater) when they open. This mixes with the wine and butter to create a natural emulsion. The cooking time is brief (5–10 minutes); as soon as the shells open, they are done. Unopened mussels must be discarded.12
Flavor Profile:
Briny, oceanic, and aromatic. The sauce is thin but flavorful, ideal for sipping or soaking up with low-carb bread alternatives.
