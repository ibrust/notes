 Keto Bang Bang Shrimp with Coconut Flour Breading
"Bang Bang" shrimp is a popular American restaurant appetizer, typified by the version at Bonefish Grill. It is traditionally heavily breaded in wheat flour and cornstarch, then deep-fried and tossed in a sugary mayonnaise-chili sauce. The keto version reconstructs this using low-carb flours and alternative sweeteners to mimic the "crunch" and "glaze" experience.
Ingredient Sourcing and Chemistry
The crunchy exterior is achieved using a mixture of Coconut Flour (1/2 cup) and crushed Moon Cheese (Pepper Jack flavor, 1/4 cup) or parmesan crisps. Coconut flour is highly absorbent, creating a crisp crust when fried, while the cheese adds savory depth and crunch that mimics the texture of fried batter.6 Moon Cheese is a shelf-stable dehydrated cheese product found in the snack aisle or salad topping section of US supermarkets.
The sauce is the critical component. Traditional sweet chili sauce is primarily high-fructose corn syrup. The keto variant utilizes a homemade Sugar-Free Sweet Chili Sauce made from Rice Vinegar, Garlic, Sambal Oelek (chili paste), and a Keto Sweetener (such as Erythritol or Monk Fruit). Xanthan Gum (1/4 tsp) is used as a hydrocolloid thickener to replicate the viscosity and "cling" of sugary syrup.6
Culinary Technique
Breading Adhesion: Shrimp are dipped in beaten egg (1 large) and then dredged in the coconut flour/cheese mixture. Because coconut flour does not develop gluten, the coating is fragile. It requires a shallow fry in hot oil (350°F) rather than deep frying to prevent the breading from washing away.6
Hydrocolloid Thickening: The sweet chili base is mixed with Mayonnaise (1/4 cup). The xanthan gum in the chili base prevents the water phase (vinegar) from separating from the oil phase (mayonnaise), creating a stable, creamy coating that coats the shrimp evenly without sliding off.6
Sauce Application: The sauce should be drizzled or gently tossed immediately before serving to maintain the textural contrast between the crisp coating and the creamy sauce.6
Flavor Profile:
This dish offers a complex juxtaposition of textures and flavors: the hot, crispy shrimp against the cool, creamy, spicy-sweet sauce. The coconut flour provides a slight inherent sweetness that complements the chili, creating a profile that satisfies cravings for "takeout" style dishes.6
