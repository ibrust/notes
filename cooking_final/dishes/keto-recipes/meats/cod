10. Lemon Butter Baked Cod: The Poaching Technique
Culinary Gap Addressed: White fish preparation; compound butter usage.
Key Ingredient: Cod Loins (thick cut).
The Architectural Concept
Cod is a lean, flaky fish that can dry out easily. This recipe uses a technique where the fish is topped with a compound butter before baking. As the butter melts, it bastes the fish, essentially shallow-poaching it in lipid. This prevents the delicate protein structure from tightening up.35
Ingredient Specifications and Sourcing
Protein Substrate: Cod Loins. The "loin" is the thickest part of the fillet and cooks more evenly than the thin tail sections.35
The Fat: Butter mixed with lemon zest, garlic, and parsley.
The "Crust": An optional dusting of Parmesan cheese can be added for texture, but the focus here is on the butter bath.37
Thermodynamic Execution
Compound Butter: The butter is softened and mixed with flavorings.
Application: The butter is slathered onto the cold fish.
The Roast: The fish is baked at 400°F. The butter melts immediately, surrounding the fish. The high heat creates a slight browning on the butter solids while the fish steams gently inside the fat coating.36
Doneness: Removed exactly when the fish turns opaque (140°F–145°F).35
Nutritional Implications
Cod is a dense source of protein and iodine. This preparation adds the necessary fat calories to make it a complete keto meal.
