13. Broccoli Cheese Soup: The Sodium Citrate Emulsion
Culinary Gap Addressed: Cream soups without roux; utilization of specific melting salts.
Key Ingredient: Broccoli and Cheddar Cheese.
The Architectural Concept
Most restaurant broccoli soups start with a flour/butter roux to thicken the broth. In keto, we use heavy cream and cream cheese. Cream cheese contains stabilizers (gums) and emulsifiers that prevent the cheddar from breaking into a greasy mess. This creates a velvety texture without starch.44
Ingredient Specifications and Sourcing
Vegetable Base: Fresh broccoli florets.
Liquid: Chicken bone broth and heavy whipping cream.44
The Stabilizer: Cream Cheese.
Flavor: Sharp Cheddar, garlic, and nutmeg (a classic béchamel spice that enhances dairy flavors).45
Thermodynamic Execution
Simmering: Broccoli is cooked in broth until tender.
Mechanical Thickening: An immersion blender is used to puree about half of the broccoli. The vegetable fiber itself thickens the soup.44
Low-Heat Melting: The heat must be reduced before adding the cheese. High heat causes cheese proteins to tighten and separate from the fat (curdling). The cheese is stirred in gradually until the emulsion forms.46
Nutritional Implications
A high-calcium, high-fat soup that feels indulgent but is composed entirely of low-glycemic vegetables and dairy.
