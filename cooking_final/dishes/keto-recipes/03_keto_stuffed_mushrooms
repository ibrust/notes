KETO STUFFED MUSHROOMS - DONE
===================================================

Cooking stuffed mushrooms requires moisture management, and balancing heavy lipids with acidity. 
    In a keto context it also means reconstructing the crunch that's normally provided by breadcrumbs. 

Traditional stuffed mushrooms rely heavily on breadcrumbs, both in the filling (to bind moisture) and on top (for texture). 
    Without breadcrumbs, fillings tend to weep oil and collapse due to lack of structure. 
    On the other hand, by replacing the breadcrumbs neutral starches with other ingredients (protein, fat) 
        we increase the flavor density. Bread dilutes flavor. Pork rinds and parmesan amplify it. 

    Our goal with this recipe is 3 fold: 
        - to maintain structural integrity (the mushroom should maintain its shape and retain the filling)
        - to address the water issue (mushrooms should be juicy but not wet)
        - to ensure the filling hax flavor complexity. It must transcend the monotony of salt and fat. 

We'll use Cremini mushrooms (usually labeled "Baby Bella")
    Both Cremini and White Button mushrooms are the same species (Agaricus bisporus). 
    But White Buttons are picked early in development, and are mild in flavor. 
    Cremini are picked later, and have a lower water amount / a more robust, nutty flavor.

It's a widespread myth that if you wash mushrooms, they'll absorb tons of water. 
    Some people will recommend only wiping off the mushrooms because of this myth. 
        But that often doesn't get all the grit. 
    In reality they barely absorb any water when washed - even if they're soaked for a prolonged time. 

    But we still want to be able to brown the surface, 
        so we will put the mushrooms through a salad spinner after washing, and dry them off with paper towels afterwards. 

The stem is denser and tougher than the cap. 
    It must be removed to create the cavity. 
    
    However, the stem is rich in free glutamates.
        So we will finely chop and sautee them, then use them in the filling, reinforcing the fungal flavor profile. 

The gills in Cremini occupy voluable volume (which can be filling instead), and can introduce bitter flavors. 
    Though the AI recommends using a teaspoon to gently scrape out the black gills, I found this to be tedious and unnecessary.

The main failure mode of stuffed mushrooms is the release of water during baking. 
    If a raw mushroom is stuffed and baked, the heat causes the chitin cell walls to break down, releasing water. 
    This water pools at the bottom of the mushroom, boiling the filling from the bottom up and making the whole thing soggy. 

    To avoid this, we'll roast the empty caps, stem side down, at 400F for 10-15 minutes before stuffing. 
        This removes ~30-40% of the water. It also concentrates the mushroom flavor. 

A common m istake is using raw sausage in the filling, hoping it cooks inside the mushroom. 
    This releases rendered fat that breaks the emulsion of the cheese, causing the filling to separate and become greasy. 
    We'll use hot italian sausage, and precook it / render its fat beforehand. 

    Hot italian sausage will typically be spiced with fennel, anise, red pepper flakes, and paprika. 
        This will provide a complex flavor profile without us adding too many individual spices. 

    Pork sausage typically is 20-30% fat. 
        This is ideal for keto, but will require additional cooking to ensure the fat renders out. 
        The sausage will have to be browned aggressively in a skillet. 
            That'll also give us a good Maillard reaction. 
    
    We also want to ensure the meat is broken down into fine crumbs, not chunks. 
        This allows it to integrate fully with the cream cheese binder. 

When glutamates and nucleotides (inosinates) interact on the tongue, savoriness is amplified ~8 times. 
    We'll get glutamates from aged parmesan (24 months), and the sauteed mushroom stems.
        As cheese ages, proteolysis breaks down casein proteins into free amino acids, including glutamate. 
    The inosinates are provided by the pork sausage, and some anchovy paste. 
        A small amount of anchovy paste provides alot of inosinates which will amplify the glutamates. 

Cream cheese will be the continuous phase inwhich the sausage and aromatics are dispersed. 
It is critical that the cream cheese be softened to room temperature before mixing. 
    Cold cream cheese will not emulsify with the warm sausage fat, leading to pockets of grease. 

While many recipes use a 1:1 meat to cheese ratio, we'll use 2:1. 
    The extra meat creates a filling that eats like a substantial meal, not a condiment. 
    It also increases structural stability and protein density. 

Due to the high fat content, we'll add fresh lemon juice to brighten the flavor profile and cut through the fat. 
We'll also use some dry white wine to deglaze the pan after cooking the sausage and stems. 
    This will incorporate the fond into the filling, and add a tartaric acid backbone that balances the richness of the fat. 

Traditionally breadcrumbs serve two roles: 
    - they absorb excess moisture and fat within the filling
    - they provide a crispy texture that contrasts the soft mushroom 

    We'll have to replicate these functions without wheat. 

    To bind the filling, we'll use a single egg yolk instead. 
        This will bind the water in the cream cheese to the fat in the sausage. 
        It also sets slightly upon heating, giving the filling a custard-like firmness. 

    We'll also use pork rinds for their rigidity and crunchiness. 
        We'll mix them into the grated parmesan. 
        As the parmesan melts, it'll fuse the pork rinds into a cohesive shell on top of the mushroom.

anchovy paste, 1 tsp 
hot italian sausage, 1 lb 

===================================================
NOTEWORTHY EQUIPMENT 
===================================================

===================================================
INGREDIENTS
===================================================

large cremini mushrooms, ~40 count
shallots, 1/4 cup 
garlic cloves, 4 
fresh parsley, 2 tbsp 
fresh thyme, 1 tsp 
lemon juice, 1 tbsp
lemon zest, 1 tsp 

hot italian sausage, 1 lb
cream cheese, 8 oz (225 g)

anchovy paste, 1 tsp 
red pepper flakes, 1/4 tsp 
black pepper, 1/4 tsp 
salt (to taste - but likely a minimal amount due to sausage/cheese/anchovy)

parmigiano-reggiano, 1 cup, grated
pork rinds, 1 cup 
olive oil, 2 tbsp 
1 large egg yolk 
1/2 cup of dry Sauvignon Blanc white wine

===================================================
PREPARATION 
===================================================

1) prepare the mushrooms 
    a) preheat oven to 400F (the higher temp encourages evaporation and browning, not steaming) 
    b) place mushrooms in a bowl & rinse briefly with cold water 
    c) transfer to a salad spinner & spin dry 
    d) pat thoroughly with paper towels 
    e) remove the stems & put them in a bowl 
    f) chop the stems very fine (they should be smaller than a peppercorn) 

2) dehydrate the mushrooms 
    a) add 1 tbsp olive oil & a pinch of salt to a large bowl 
    b) put the mushroom caps into the bowl & toss them with the oil / salt 
    c) arrange the mushrooms, stem-side down, on a wire rack set over a rimmed baking sheet.
        the rack allows air to circulate and prevents the mushrooms from sitting in the liquid they release
    d) roast for 15 minutes. you will see liquid dropping from the mushrooms. 
    e) remove from the oven & let them cool on the rack 
    f) blot any remaining moisture in the caps with a small paper towel 

3) prepare the saute vegetables
    a) dice 1 shallot
    b) dice the 4 garlic cloves


3) cook the sausage
    a) cut up the sausage into rounds 
    b) heat a large stainless-steel skillet to 400F (medium-high on a normal burner)
    c) add the sausage
    d) throughout the saute, continuously break sausage up with a wooden spoon into very fine crumbles
    e) cook undisturbed for 2-3 minutes to begin getting a hard sear 
    f) stir and continue cooking 8-10 minutes until fully browned
    g) if there is excess grease, drain it off, but leave 1-2 tbsp for the vegetables. 

4) add the vegetables (keeping the sausage in the pan)
    a) reduce heat to 350F (medium on a normal skillet, medium-low on ours)
    b) add the minced shallots / chopped mushroom stems to the pan 
    c) saute for 5-6 minutes until the stems have released their moisture / the shallots are soft and translucent 
        make sure the mushroom stems are cooked dry. if they're wet, they'll degrade the filling. 

5) add the spices 
    d) add the following to the pan: 
        - minced garlic 
        - anchovy paste
        - thyme 
        - red pepper flakes 
    e) cook for 1 minute until fragrant. Do not burn the garlic 

6) deglaze with white wine 
    a) pour 2 tbsp of dry white wine into the pan (or chicken broth if avoiding alcohol) 
        If using a gas stove, remove the pan from the flame briefly to avoid alcohol ignition. 
    b) Immediately use a wooden spatula to scrape the bottom of the pan
    c) cook until the liquid has almost completely evaporated. 
    d) remove the pan from heat and let cool for 10 minutes
        if you add hot sausage to the cream cheese, the cheese will melt and the fat will separate. 
        the mixture needs to be lukewarm. 

7) create the stuffing 
    a) in a large bowl combine the following: 
        - softened cream cheese 
        - the cooled sausage mixture 
        - 1 egg yolk 
        - lemon juice 
        - lemon zest 
        - parsley 
        - black pepper
        - 1/2 cup of the grated parmesan (not all of it)
    b) mix vigorously with your hands 
        the mixture should be sticky and thick 
    
8) stuff the mushrooms
    a) arrange the mushroom caps cup-side up. 
    b) fill each cap generously. 
        create a high mound. do not level it off. the filling is dense enough to support a dome shape. 

9) top the mushrooms 
    a) in a small bowl add the following: 
        - 1 cup crushed pork rinds 
        - 1/2 cup grated parmesesan 
        - 2 tbsp olive oil (this helps conduct heat to the pork rinds, ensuring they brown evenly)
    b) invert each mushroom (holding the filling) into the bowl of crumbs to coat the top generously, 
        or sprinkle the crumbs heavily on them while pressing down gently to adhere 

10) cook the mushrooms 
    a) line the baking sheet with parchment paper
    b) transfer the stuffed mushrooms from the wire rack to the baking sheet 
    c) bake at 400F for 15-20 minutes. 
        when it's done the crust should be golden brown, and the filling should reach 160F
    d) remove from oven and let rest for 5-10 minutes.
        This allows the fats to re-solidify slightly, ensuring the filling won't slide out.

MEAL COMBINATIONS
===================================================

Some variations to the recipe: 
    - add 1/2 of frozen spinach to the filling. requires thawing & dehydrating since spinach has alot of water
    - add crab meat to it & adjust the rest of the recipe (seasoning, cream cheese amount, other things)
