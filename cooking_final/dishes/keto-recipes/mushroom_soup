Creamy Mushroom Soup (Puree Method)
Most commercial mushroom soups are starch-heavy. This recipe uses the fibrous body of the mushroom itself to thicken the broth.35
Umami Amplification
Mushrooms are rich in natural glutamates. Browning them deeply (Maillard reaction) before adding liquid is critical to developing a flavor profile that doesn't need MSG or artificial boosters.37
Preparation Methodology
Ingredients:
1 lb Cremini or Button Mushrooms, sliced.
4 tbsp Butter.
1/2 Onion, chopped.
1 quart Chicken or Vegetable Bone Broth.
1/2 cup Heavy Cream.
Fresh Thyme.
Procedure:
The Brown: Sauté mushrooms and onions in butter. Do not rush—cook them until the liquid is released and evaporates, and the mushrooms turn dark brown.38
Deglazing: Add a splash of sherry or vinegar (optional) or just the broth to scrape up the browned bits (fond) from the pot.
Simmer: Add remaining broth and thyme. Simmer for 15 minutes to soften mushrooms completely.
Mechanical Thickening: Transfer about 1/3 to 1/2 of the soup (solids and liquid) to a blender (or use an immersion blender). Blitz until perfectly smooth.
Reintegration: Pour the puree back into the pot. The blended mushrooms act as a thickener, giving the soup body. Stir in the heavy cream for richness.35
