Spinach and Artichoke Dip (The Casserole)
While technically a "dip," when prepared with a high volume of vegetables and baked, this dish functions as a rich vegetable side or even a main course. It is arguably the most palatable way to consume large quantities of spinach.43
Ingredient Synergy
Artichokes provide inulin, a prebiotic fiber. Spinach provides vitamins A and K. The high-fat dairy matrix (cream cheese, mayo, sour cream) ensures the fat-soluble vitamins are absorbed.
Preparation Methodology
Ingredients:
10 oz Frozen Spinach (thawed, squeezed dry).
14 oz can Artichoke Hearts (drained, chopped).
8 oz Cream Cheese (softened).
1/4 cup Sour Cream.
1/4 cup Mayonnaise.
1 cup Mozzarella Cheese.
1/2 cup Parmesan.
Garlic.
Procedure:
The Matrix: Beat the cream cheese, sour cream, and mayo until smooth. The mayonnaise adds oil and egg protein, which helps the dip brown and prevents the cheese from separating.44
Assembly: Fold in the dry spinach, chopped artichokes, garlic, and cheeses.
Baking: Transfer to a baking dish. Bake at 375°F (190°C) for 20–25 minutes until the top is golden and bubbling.
Usage: Serve with raw vegetable crudités (celery, cucumber slices) or eat with a spoon as a vegetable gratin.45
