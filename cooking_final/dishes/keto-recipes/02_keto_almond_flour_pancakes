RECIPE NAME / DESCRIPTION - DONE
===================================================

Keto pancakes lack gluten, which forms the viscoelastic protein network responsible for gas retention and elasticity, 
They also lack starch, the primary thickening agent that set's the pancakes structure between 140-180F. 

There are 3 challenges to making keto pancakes: 
    1) to create a stable emulsion that can hold gas bubbles (without using gluten) 
    2) to achieve fluffy vertical reise in a batter that's significantly heavier 
    3) to keep the flavor rich in buttery depth and aromatic complexity

In normal pancakes, water does 2 things: 
    1) hydrates glutenin / gliadin to form gluten. 
    2) swells starch granulates until they burst and gelatinize. 

In almond flour pancakes, the lipids within the almond flour cause it to resist hydration.
    This leads to a batter that separates if not properly emulsified. 
    This failure often results in "wet" or "soggy" centers in keto pancakes, even while the exterior is burned. 

    To counteract this we must use bridging agents which either: 
        - act as both hydrophilic and lipophilic
        - possess such hygroscopicity (water-absorbing capacity) tha they force the moisture to bind 
    This is why we use coconut flour and whey protein


Almond flour is rich in amino acids (arginine, glutamic acid, aspartic acid).
    This means it easily undergoes the Maillard reaction. 
    However, the lack of reducing sugars in a keto context is problematic (a necessary ingredient in the reaction) . 
        For this we must rely on the browning properties of Allulose and the lactose/proteins in dairy or whey. 

The high fat content of almond flour lowers the specific heat capacity of the batter. 
    So it heats up and transfers heat differently than a water-heavy batter. 
    Almond flour burns at lower exposure times than wheat flour. 
    
    We must cook these pancakes at a lower heat (325F) over a longer time to ensure internal heat pentration before burning.


To achieve fluffiness without gluten we must create a surrogate protein network to trap air bubbles with. 
    This is achieved via denatured egg proteins (albumin) and whey proteins, which coagulate upon heating,
    forming a rigid mesh that traps gas. 

    We'll also use whipped egg whites to pre-load the batter with extra bubbles. 


The choice of flour is the most important thing. 
    The distinction between almond meal and almond flour is sometimes ignored. 
        Almond meal is ground with the skins on. The skins contain tannins, which add astringency and bitterness. 
            Furthermore, the grind is coarse, and the large particles will disrupt the batter's continuity. 
            This results in a gritty pancake and a tendency for it to crumble upon flipping. 
        We will use superfine blanched almond flour.
            Blanching removes the skin, eliminating bitterness and ensuring it browns predictably.  
            Superfine milling ensures the oil bodies within the almond cells can emulsify with the lipid ingredients,
                but not so much that the flour becomes almond butter. 
                The increased surface area of sueprfine flour allows for maximum interaction with the binding agents. 
                This is essential for mimicking the softness of wheat.  
                Kirkland (Costco), Blue Diamond, or Wholesome Yum are frequently cited as good brands for this type of flour.

We'll also add flavor by browning the butter. 
    We won't toast the almond flour, because that could dry it out, reducing its hydration capacity. 

Almond flour by itself lacks the strength and moisture control that's required. 
    Coconut flour is composed of ~60% fiber, making it very hygroscopic. 
        It absorbs 4 times its weight in liquid compared to almond flour. 

    Coconut flour also acts as a locking agent, holding moisture in the pancake while some of the almonds oils dry out.
        This reduces the grasiness of the pancake, preventing the "wet sponge" texture, which can be an issue. 

    If used alone, coconut flour would create a dense, fibrous brick that sucks moisture out of the mouth. 
    If omitted, the pancakes would be too oily. 

    We'll include coconut flour in a ratio of about 1:6 coconut:almond (about 1.5 tbsp per cup). 
     

whey protein isolate can be used to mimic the structure lattice of gluten. 
    when denatured by heat, whey proteins form a gel-like structure. 
    This scaffolding will trap air bubbles, similar to gluten. 

    Some recipes suggest collagen for the same purpose. 
        However, collagen dissolves and becomes gelatinous upon heating, often leading to a gummy, sticky texture. 
        We want the pancakes to be fluffy. 

    Unflavored isolate is preferred to maintain control over the sweetness and vanillal intensity. 
        It also browns readily. 


To prevent the pancakes from crumbling when they're flipped we'll also have to add xantham gum. 
    This will prevent the almond particles from settling at the bottom of the batter, and provides a slight elasticity. 
    A miniscule amount (1/4 tsp per cup of flour) is sufficient.

    While some recipes use guar gum, xanthan is generally superior for heat stability. 
        It stabilizes the gas-liquid interface of the bubbles, ensuring they don't pop prematurely.
    

Eggs are the primary binder in keto baking. 
    However, whole eggs mixed directly would lead to a rubbery, omelet-like texture. 
    We'll separate the eggs, and use the yolks as emulsifiers while whipping the whites for lift. 

    Yolks will help bind the fats (i.e. brown butter) and the liquid (almond milk). 


Keto pancake batter is significantly heavier due to the density of almond flour. 
    To get it to rise, we'll need extra chemical leavener. 
    Almond flour batters require about double the amount of leavening powder. 
    A ratio of 1.5-2 tsp of baking powder per cup of almond flour is optimal. 

Traditional pancakes use buttermilk to provide acid to react with the leaveners. 
    Our keto pancakes will use apple cider vinegar for this purpose (though lemon juice is another option). 

    In addition to instigating rice, the acid here will tenderize the protein network, preventing rubberiness. 
        It will also add a subtle tang that cuts through the richness of the almond fat. 

We'll whip the egg whites to soft peaks before folding them in. 


Allulose is a rare sugar that behaves chemically like sucrose.
    It creates no cooling after taste (unlike erythritol). 
    It also caramelizes and browns (allowing us to achieve the golden-brown crust we're after). 
    Beware, it browns faster than sugar, necessitating careful heat control. 

    A blend of allulose & monk fruit is also a viable option. 


We'll also add in a few aromatics. 
    1) vanilla bean paste - preferred over the extract 
    2) almond extract - used in trace amounts (1/8 tsp). It amplifies the natural almond flavor without tasting artificial.
        It provides a marzipan undertone that registers as sweet to teh brain, even without sugar.  
    3) salt - suppresses bitterness and enhances sweetness. 
    4) nutmeg - a trace of this creates a spiced, bakery scent that mimics traditional baked goods

RARE INGREDIENTS
===================================================

===================================================
NOTEWORTHY EQUIPMENT 
===================================================

===================================================
INGREDIENTS
===================================================

unsalted butter, 3 tbsp 
superfine blanched almond flour, sifted, 110g (or 1 cup, but weighing is recommended) 
coconut flour, sifted, 12g (or 1.5 tbsp)
unflavored whey protein isolate, 2 tbsp 
granulated allulose, 3 tbsp 
baking powder, 1.5 tsp 
xanthan gum, 1/4 tsp 
fine sea salt, 1/2 tsp 
nutmeg, 1/8 tsp 
2 large eggs 
unsweetened almond milk, 1/4 cup 
apple cider vinegar, 1 tsp (though lemon juice, 1 tsp is also an option)
vanilla bean paste, 2 tsp 
almond extract, 1/8 tsp 
ghee or avocado oil (for greasing the pan - do not use butter, it'll burn)


===================================================
PREPARATION 
===================================================

1) brown the butter 
    a) place 3 tbsp unsalted butter in a stainless steel skillet 
    b) begin heating the pan on medium 
    c) stir constantly
    d) after the foam subsides watch for them to turn brown 
    e) the moment the butter turns brown, pour the butter into a glass or metal bowl, 
        preferably one large enough to stop the cooking

2) mix the dry ingredients 
    a) in a large bowl (eventually used as the main bowl) add:
        i) 110g sifted almond flour 
        ii) 12g sifted coconut flour 
        iii) 2 tbsp whey protein 
        iv) 3 tbsp granulated allulose (and monkfruit if used) 
        v) 1.5 tsp baking powder 
        vi) 1/4 tsp xanthan gum 
        vii) 1/2 tsp fine sea salt 
        viii) 1/8 tsp nutmeg
    b) whisk the ingredients 

3) mix the wet ingredients 
    a) in a large bowl add: 
        i) almond milk, 1/4 cup
        ii) apple cider vinegar, 1 tsp
    b) stir lightly to combine 
    c) let that sit for 2 minutes. the acid will curdle the milk slightly, creating a pseudo-buttermilk 
    d) in a separate bowl add: 
        i) 2 egg yolks 
        ii) 3 tbs brown butter (cooled) 
        iii) 2 tsp vanilla paste 
        iv) 1/8 tsp almond extract 
    e) whisk all the wet ingredients together in the large bowl until completely emulsified and glossy 

4) combine wet and dry ingredients 
    a) pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients
    b) stir with a spatula until just combined 
    c) let batter sit for 5-10 minutes
        this allows the coconut flour fibers and xanthan gum to hydrate f ully 

4) whip the egg whites until soft peaks  (do this while the batter rests for 5-10 minutes)

5) fold in eggwhites 
    a) take 1/3 of the egg whites and stir them vigorously into the thickened almond batter (I'm skeptical of this technique)
    b) gently fold the remaining 2/3 of the egg whites into the batter 
        i) cut down the middle
        ii) scoop up the bottom 
        iii) turn over 
        iv) repeat until just combined.
            streaks of white are better than deflated batter. 

6) cook pancakes 
    a) preheat a pan with a lid to 325F (usually medium-low)
    b) add some avocado spray or ghee to the surface
    c) wipe away excess oil with paper towel, it will cause uneven browning otherwise 
    d) scoop 1/4 cup portions onto the skillet. 
        do not crowd the pan (3 at a time max) 
        these are more delicate to flip than wheat pancakes. 
        very gently spread batter with back of the scooper 
    e) cover the pan with a lid.
        this is critical for keto pancakes.
        it captures steam, creating an oven-like environment that sets the center quicker (cooking the egg / whey network)
    f) cook for 3-4 minutes.
        look for bubbles that have formed and popped. 
    g) flip, uncover, & cook for another 2-3 minutes 


===================================================
SERVING
===================================================

===================================================
MEAL COMBINATIONS
===================================================

Try serving it with sugar-free syrup made from the allulose: 
    Simmer 1/2 cup water, 1 cup Allulose, and 1 tsp Maple Extract until slightly thickened. 
        Allulose has the unique property of thickening into a syrup consistency upon boiling.
    Whisk in a pat of butter at the end for viscosity.

===================================================
TEST RESULTS / ADJUSTMENTS
===================================================

- if pancake breaks apart when flipped try using a smaller pancake size 
- if the outside is burning the heat is too high, or the sweetener is incompatible 
- if the center is wet and eggy, it could be due to the lack of steam (cooking without lid). 
    it could also be due to the heat being too high, cooking the outside too fast.
