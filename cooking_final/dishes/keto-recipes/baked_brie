5. Baked Brie with Walnuts and Herbs
Brie is a soft-ripened cheese characterized by a bloomy rind of white mold (Penicillium camemberti). This rind is not just packaging; it is a flavor agent and a structural container. Baking Brie transforms the interior paste into a liquid fondue, creating a communal dining experience.
The Biochemistry of Ripening
During the aging of Brie, the mold on the surface secretes enzymes that break down proteins (proteolysis) and fats (lipolysis) in the cheese paste. This breakdown moves from the rind inward, creating the creamy texture. When baked, the fat structure softens further, becoming fluid. The rind, however, remains firm, acting as a natural bowl.21
Recipe Architecture:
The Cheese: A wheel of double-cream (60% butterfat in dry matter) or triple-cream (75% butterfat) Brie. The higher fat content is preferable for keto.
The Topping: Walnuts and fresh herbs (rosemary or thyme).
The Method: The wheel is placed in a baking dish or skillet. The top rind can be scored to allow heat to penetrate or left whole. It is baked at 400°F (200°C) for 10-15 minutes.23
Nutritional Synergy:
Walnuts are added to the top before baking. The heat toasts the walnuts, releasing their oils which mingle with the melting cheese. This combination balances the saturated fat of the cheese with the polyunsaturated fats of the nuts. The tannins in the walnuts skins also cut through the creaminess of the Brie, providing flavor balance without sweetness.24
Serving Vehicle:
In the absence of bread, this baked cheese is best eaten with slices of raw bell pepper, cucumber, or simply by the spoonful. It is an extremely high-calorie density dish, suitable for OMAD (One Meal A Day) keto practitioners or as a substantial appetizer.
