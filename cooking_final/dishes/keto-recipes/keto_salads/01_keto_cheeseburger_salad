The Keto Cheeseburger Salad (Big Mac Deconstruction)
This recipe is a strategic culinary intervention designed to satisfy cravings for fast food while strictly adhering to ketogenic parameters. It deconstructs the classic cheeseburger, retaining the beef, cheese, and pickle flavor triad while eliminating the bun.
3.2.1 Reconstructing the "Special Sauce"
The psychological satisfaction of this dish relies heavily on the dressing. A keto-compliant "special sauce" is engineered by combining mayonnaise with sugar-free ketchup (or a small amount of tomato paste), mustard, and vinegar. Finely chopped dill pickles provide the essential tartness without the sugar load of relish.7
3.2.2 Ingredient Specifications
Beef: 80/20 ground beef is recommended over lean variants. The higher fat content (20%) increases satiety and provides a softer, more palatable crumble in the salad context.
Cheese: Sharp Cheddar is preferred for its robust flavor, allowing a moderate quantity to deliver significant taste impact.
Execution Protocol:
Meat Preparation: Brown 1 lb of ground beef in a skillet. Season aggressively with salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Do not drain the rendered fat; pour it over the greens to increase the lipid content of the meal.
Dressing Formulation: Mix 1/2 cup mayonnaise, 2 tbsp chopped sugar-free pickles, 2 tsp yellow mustard, 1 tsp white vinegar, and 1/2 tsp smoked paprika.
Base: Chop a head of iceberg lettuce. While less nutrient-dense than spinach, iceberg provides the specific watery crunch associated with burger toppings.
Layering: Top the lettuce with the warm beef, 3/4 cup shredded cheddar, 1/2 cup diced pickles, and 1/4 cup diced onions.
Garnish: Sprinkle with toasted sesame seeds to evoke the flavor of the sesame seed bun.9
