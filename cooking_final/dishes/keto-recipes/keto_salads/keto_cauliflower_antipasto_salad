Keto Antipasto Salad
This salad functions as a deconstructed charcuterie board. It is exceptionally high in sodium and fat, making it ideal for keto dieters who need to replenish electrolytes after exercise. It utilizes steamed cauliflower as a bulking agent to replace pasta, absorbing the vinaigrette.
Execution Protocol:
Cauliflower Prep: Steam 1 head of cauliflower florets until just tender (al dente). Do not overcook to mush. Drain and pat completely dry.
Marination: Whisk a dressing of 1 cup olive oil, 1/2 cup red wine vinegar, garlic powder, oregano, and salt. Pour half over the warm cauliflower and refrigerate for 1 hour (or overnight). The warm vegetable absorbs the acid and oil, infusing it with flavor.17
Assembly: Add 1/2 lb chopped Genoa salami, 1/2 lb chopped prosciutto, 8 oz fresh mozzarella balls (bocconcini), 3 oz sliced black olives, 5 oz roasted red peppers, and 13 oz artichoke hearts (drained).
Finish: Toss with the remaining dressing and fresh basil leaves.
