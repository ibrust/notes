Parfait: The Winter Brightness (Citrus Supreme, Mint & Pistachio)
Concept: When berries are out of season, citrus reigns. This parfait relies on the "Supreme" cutting technique to remove bitter pith and membranes, leaving only pure, bursting vesicles of juice.
The Dairy: Herbed Honey Yogurt.
•	Technique: Mix 1.5 cups of Greek yogurt with 1 tablespoon of chopped fresh mint and 1 tablespoon of honey. The herbs add a fresh, garden-like quality that pairs beautifully with citrus.31
The Fruit: Winter Citrus Segments.
•	Technique: Use a mix of Blood Orange, Cara Cara Orange, and Grapefruit for color contrast (red, orange, pink). Supreme the fruit: Slice off the top and bottom, cut away the skin and pith following the curve of the fruit, and then carefully slice between the membranes to release the segments. Squeeze the remaining membrane skeleton to harvest the fresh juice.32
The Crunch: Roasted Pistachios and Pomegranate Arils.
•	Technique: Roast shelled pistachios until fragrant and chop coarsely. Combine with fresh pomegranate seeds (arils) for a jewel-like finish and a pop of juicy crunch.
Assembly Protocol:
1.	Layer the mint yogurt.
2.	Arrange the citrus segments on top.
3.	Scatter the pistachios and pomegranate seeds.
4.	Finish: Drizzle the reserved fresh citrus juice and a touch of extra virgin olive oil over the top. The oil adds a velvety mouthfeel and richness to the acid-heavy dish.
