19. Mojito Fruit Salad: The Cocktail Deconstruction

Herbal Infusion
Inspired by the Cuban highball, this salad uses fresh mint and lime as the primary flavoring agents. It represents a shift away from dairy-based dressings toward light, translucent glazes that highlight the fruit's natural color.62
The Glaze
A simple syrup is often infused with mint leaves (muddled or steeped) and lime zest.
•	Watermelon Synergy: Watermelon is the star here; its porous texture absorbs the lime-mint liquid rapidly.
•	Alcohol Optional: While rum can be added, the non-alcoholic version relies on the suggestion of the cocktail flavor profile to feel sophisticated and adult.63
