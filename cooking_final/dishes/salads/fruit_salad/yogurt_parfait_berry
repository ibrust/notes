The Textural Purist (Macerated Berry & Whipped Vanilla Bean)
Concept: This is the elevation of the standard "berries and cream" model. The focus here is on maceration to transform the fruit into a self-saucing compote and aeration to lighten the yogurt into a cloud-like mousse. It relies on the contrast between the pristine white yogurt and the bleeding red syrup of the fruit.
The Dairy: Vanilla Bean Whipped Greek Yogurt.
•	Technique: Combine 1 cup of cold, full-fat Greek yogurt with 1/2 cup of heavy whipping cream and 1 tablespoon of maple syrup. Split a vanilla bean and scrape the seeds directly into the mixture. Whisk on high speed until soft peaks form (approx. 2-3 minutes). The inclusion of air makes the texture ethereal, while the cream fat stabilizes the acidity.5
The Fruit: Citrus-Macerated Mixed Berries.
•	Technique: Combine fresh strawberries (hulled and quartered), blueberries, and blackberries. Add 10% of their weight in caster sugar and 1 tablespoon of fresh lemon juice. Let sit at room temperature for 30 minutes. The sugar will draw out the cellular water via osmosis, creating a vibrant, ruby-red natural syrup that is far superior to artificial sauces.9
The Crunch: Almond and Egg-White Granola.
•	Technique: Use an egg-white binder granola with sliced almonds and oats. The egg white creates large, distinct clusters that maintain their integrity against the berry syrup.
Assembly Protocol:
1.	Spoon a layer of macerated berries and their syrup into the bottom of a clear glass.
2.	Add a thick layer of the whipped vanilla yogurt.
3.	Add a second layer of berries, allowing the syrup to drizzle down the sides of the glass for visual marbling.
4.	Top with a generous handful of the almond granola clusters.
5.	Result: A balance of light, airy dairy and dense, syrupy fruit with a shatteringly crisp finish.
