ENSALADA DE FRUTAS
==============================================

The ingredients of this dish must be chopped very finely, so that when eaten with a spoon all ingredients will be present. 

The key ingredient is the mango. the type of mango you'll find will vary with the seasons. 

    - Tommy Atkins mangos (medium size and red/green/yellow) 
        These dominate the US market all year, but you want to avoid them. 
        They're preferred by retailers for their thick skin, resistance to anthracnose fungus, and long shelf life.
        Unfortunately they're less sweet and more fibrous than other varieties. 
    - Ataulfo mangos (small & yellow, often labeled honey, champagne, or adolfo) 
        these are very sweet & have zero fiber and are ideal for our dish. 
        but they're mainly available between march & june 
    - kent mangos (large & green, might have some red blush, will not turn yellow) 
        low amount of fiber
    - kiett mangos (large & green. stays mostly green when ripe, may have a slight amount of pink) 
        almost entirely fiber free.
        firm, has a sweet lemon flavor 
    - palmer mangos (often purple or red)
        has a mild flavor & smooth texture 

    March-June: 
        this is mango season, find some Ataulfo mangos
    June-August: 
        look for Kent (early summer) or Kiett (arrives later in the summer usually) 
    September-November: 
        this is the hardest time to find good mango. the mexican season ends, and brazillian imports begin.  
        if you can't find Kiett or Palmer, see if you can find frozen mango that isn't Tommy Atkins. 
    December-February
        Kent (shipped in from Peru) is the best bet
