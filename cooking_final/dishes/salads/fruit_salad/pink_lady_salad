PREPARATION  
=======================================

1) Prepare the Strawberry Gellatin: 
    a) place the 1.5 cups freeze-dried strawberries and 1/2 cup sugar in a food process. 
        pulse until it's a fine pink dust (this ensures even distribution and rapid hydration)  
    b) pour 1/2 of the pineapple juice into a small bowl. 
        sprinkle the gelatin powder evenly over the surface. 
        do not dump it out in a mound. 
        let it stand for 5-10 minutes. the mixture will absorb the juice. 
    c) bring the other 1/2 cup pineapple juice to a simmer.
        pour it over the bloomed gelatin and whisk gently until it's completely dissolved. 
        there should be no granules left on the whisk.
    d) whisk the strawberry/sugar dust into the warm gelatin. it will form a thick, red syrup 
    e) let this syrup cool to room temperature (70F). 
        if you were to add hot syrup to the cottage cheese you'd melt the cheese and break the emulsion. 
        but if you let it get too cold it'll set and become rubbery. 
        it needs to be viscous but fluid. 

2) Prepare the Cottage Cheese base: 
    a) place the cottage cheese in a fine mesh sieve for 15 minutes. 
        this removes excess whey, preventing watery salad. 
    b) place the drained cottage cheese in a food processer and blitz for 30 seconds until smooth. 
        this eliminates the large curds. 
    c) in a alarge mixing bowl, fold the colded strawberry gellatin into the cottage cheese, 
        along with the vanilla paste. 
        the cold temperature of the cheese will begin to slowly thicken the gellatin. 

3) Prepare the Chantilly (cool whip replacement):
