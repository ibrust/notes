INGREDIENTS
===================================================

The quality and ripeness of the ingredients is the most important thing in this recipe since there's no cooking involved. 

Fruit base: 
- pineapple (1 small or 1/2 large)
- kiwis (3-4 - ideally the fuzzy green Hayward variety) 
- mandarin oranges (3-4 - clementines or satsumas are ideal)
- blueberres (1 cup) 

Dressing: 
- Limes (2-3 - for both the juice and the zest) 
- Ginger Root (1 inch knob) 
- honey (mild clover or orange blossom) 
- blue poppy seeds
- fresh mint (optional)

NOTEWORTHY EQUIPMENT REQUIRED 
===================================================

fine grater (for the ginger & lime zest) 
paring knife (for the kiwi) 
small whisk 

===================================================
RECIPE STEPS
===================================================

1) make the dressing 

    a) get 1 teaspoon of lime zest from 2 limes into the bowl. avoid the bitter white part. 
    b) get 3 tablespoons of juice from the limes into the bowl
    c) peel the ginger and grate 1 teaspoon of ginger pulp and juice into the bowl. 
        you can optionally discard the pulp and just keep the juice
    d) add 3 tablespoons of honey 
    e) whisk vigorously until the honey dissolves completely into the juice 
    f) set this bowl aside and let it marinate for at least 10 minutes 

2) prepare the fruit 

    try to cut the fruit small and uniform in size so you get bite-size pieces and a mix of flavors 

    a) peel the pineapple and remove its inner core, then cut the pineapple into 1-inch cubes 
    b) peel the mandarines and pull them apart into segments. remove any white strands since they can be bitter. 
    c) cut the kiwi ends off, skin them with a paring knife or peeler. 
        slice the kiwis into rounds, then half-moons. this shape holds up better than cubes. 

        note: do not combine the kiwi or pineapple with anything else yet, their enzymes will start to break things down. 
        and if you wanted to prepare ahead of time you'd make the dressing and cut the other fruit, but wait to cut the kiwis

    e) rinse the blueberries, then pat them completely dry (water dilutes the dressing). add them to the bowl 

3) assemble & marinate 

    a) wait until you're serving within 30 minutes, then add the kiwi to a separate bowl with the other fruit
        pineapple contains bromelain and kiwi contains antinidin. 
        these enzymes break down proteins and soften fruit textures, so you don't want to mix things together too quickly. 

    b) pour the ginger-lime dressing over the fruit. 
        toss gently using a spatula or large spoon.
        use a folding motion to avoid crushing the berries 

    c) let the salad sit at room temperature for 15-20 minutes. 
        this allows the pineapple to release some of its juices, mingling with the lime and ginger to create a sauce 

    d) right before serving sprinkle 1 tablespoon of poppyseeds over the top and stir in. 
        adding them at the end ensures they remain crunchy 

The salad won't keep well overnight, so eat it in one meal.

ADJUSTMENTS
===================================================

due to variation in the ripeness of fruits you must taste and adjust it. 
    
    - if it's too sour (the limes are very tart of the pineapple wans't ripe enough) add in some extra honey. 
    - if it's too spicing (ginger is too strong) add more blueberries or a chopped banana (but only right before serving) 

the recipe will pair very well with yogurt. 
you can also try adding in or substituting watermelon. 
pumpkin seeds could also be worth trying

===================================================
ADDITIONS
===================================================

- it pairs very well with yogurt 
- you can try adding in watermelon 
- you can also try adding in pumpkin seeds 

- copilot thought these additions would be right: 
    - pomegranate arils (1/2 cup) 
    - persimmon (1 medium, sliced into thin wedges) 
    - cardamom (a pinch)
    - unsweetened, lightly toasted coocnut flakes (2 tsp)
    - and add the mint leaves

    it said the pmegranate would add crunch / tartness, the persimmon would balance the lime's acidity, 
    the cardamom would harmonize with the ginger and the coconut would provide a nutty, crisp counter to the juicy fruits.
