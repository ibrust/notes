. Indian Fruit Chaat: The Sulfurous Zing

The Concept of "Chaat"
Chaat refers to a category of Indian savory snacks that are typically served at roadside tracks. Fruit Chaat is a specific iteration where seasonal fruits are tossed in spices.38
Chaat Masala: The Magic Dust
The defining ingredient is Chaat Masala, a spice blend containing dried mango powder (amchur), cumin, coriander, and most importantly, Kala Namak (Black Salt).
•	Black Salt Chemistry: Kala Namak is a kiln-fired rock salt that has a distinct sulfurous aroma, reminiscent of hard-boiled eggs. When sprinkled on sweet fruit (like bananas, apples, and pomegranate), this sulfurous note creates a savory complexity that heightens the natural sweetness of the fruit through contrast.39
•	Digestive Properties: In Ayurvedic tradition, these spices are considered cooling and digestive aids, making Fruit Chaat a popular dish during fasting periods (like Ramadan or Navratri).41
