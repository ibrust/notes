9. Ensalada de Frutas (Mexican Street Style)

The Savory-Spicy Divergence
While Bionico represents the sweet side of Mexican fruit consumption, the street-style Ensalada de Frutas represents the savory/spicy spectrum. This is not typically "mixed" in a bowl with dressing but prepared in cups or bags, often eaten on the go.1
The "Tajín" Principle
The defining characteristic is the application of chili-lime seasoning (often the brand Tajín) and Chamoy (a pickled fruit sauce made from apricot or plum).
•	Ingredient Selection: Firm fruits are preferred—green mango, jicama, cucumber, and pineapple. The jicama and cucumber bridge the gap between vegetable and fruit, providing a neutral, crunchy canvas for the intense seasoning.
•	Flavor Chemistry: The combination involves distinct layers: Sweet (fruit) + Acid (lime juice) + Heat (chili powder) + Salty/Savory (salt/Chamoy). This stimulates all major taste receptors simultaneously, creating a hyper-palatable experience that is refreshing in hot climates.
