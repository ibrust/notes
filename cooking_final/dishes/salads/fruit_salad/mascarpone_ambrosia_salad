The Grand Gourmet Mascarpone Ambrosia
Target Audience: The Perfectionist. This is the gold standard for texture and stability.
Concept: This recipe replaces the mayonnaise/sour cream binder with a Mascarpone-Chantilly compound. It uses poached fresh pineapple to ensure enzymatic stability and homemade honey-marshmallow crème for natural aeration.
Phase 1: The Fruit Prep (Enzyme Control)
•	1 Fresh Pineapple: Peeled, cored, and cut into 1-inch tidbits.
•	Poaching Liquid: 2 cups water, 1 cup cane sugar, 1 vanilla bean (split).
o	Action: Simmer pineapple in liquid for 5 minutes. Cool completely. This kills the bromelain.19
•	4 Mandarin Oranges: Peeling is insufficient. You must supreme them (cut out segments between membranes) to ensure tenderness.28
•	1 cup Fresh Cherries: Pitted and halved. (Replaces dyed Maraschino cherries).
•	Protocol: Lay all prepped fruit on paper towels to dry.
Phase 2: The Stabilized Cream Base
•	1 cup Mascarpone Cheese (Cold): The high-fat stabilizer.
•	1 cup Heavy Whipping Cream (Cold): The aerator.
•	2 tbsp Powdered Sugar: Contains trace cornstarch for extra stability.
•	1 tsp Vanilla Bean Paste: For visual specks and intense flavor.
o	Action: Whip mascarpone and cream together until stiff peaks form. The mixture will be thick and velvety, akin to a soft frosting.5
Phase 3: The Natural Sweetener (Honey Fluff)
•	2 Egg Whites + 1/2 cup Honey.
o	Action: Heat honey to boiling. Whip egg whites to soft peaks. Stream in hot honey while beating. Whip until cool and glossy. This replaces commercial marshmallow crème/fluff.25
Assembly
1.	Fold the Honey Fluff into the Mascarpone Cream.
2.	Fold in the dried fruit.
3.	Add 1 cup Toasted Shredded Coconut and 1/2 cup Roasted Macadamia Nuts.
4.	Chill for 4 hours. The toasted nuts and coconut will soften slightly but retain a "snap" that raw ingredients lack
