ENSALADA DE FRUTAS - DONE
==============================================

The ingredients of this dish must be chopped very finely, so that when eaten with a spoon all ingredients will be present. 
    All fruit and vegetables should be cut into a uniform 0.5 cm (1/4 inch) dice.

The recipe strives to stimulate all 5 primary taste receptors: 
    - sweet: mango + pineapple 
    - sour: lime juice, orange juice, hibiscus in the chamoy 
    - salty: cotija cheese, salt 
    - bitter: toasted chili skins, citrus zest 
    - umami: onion, fermentation products in aged cotija 

Ripe, sweet fruit is of high importance.

The key ingredient is the mango. the type of mango you'll find will vary with the seasons. 

    - Tommy Atkins mangos (medium size and red/green/yellow) 
        These dominate the US market all year, but you want to avoid them. 
        They're preferred by retailers for their thick skin, resistance to anthracnose fungus, and long shelf life.
        Unfortunately they're less sweet and more fibrous than other varieties. 
    - Ataulfo mangos (small & yellow, often labeled honey, champagne, or adolfo) 
        these are very sweet & have zero fiber and are ideal for our dish. 
        but they're best used between march & june. earlier than that and they may be sour.
    - kent mangos (large & green, might have some red blush, will not turn yellow) 
        low amount of fiber
    - kiett mangos (large & green. stays mostly green when ripe, may have a slight amount of pink) 
        almost entirely fiber free.
        firm, has a sweet lemon flavor 
    - palmer mangos (often purple or red)
        has a mild flavor & smooth texture 

    March-June: 
        this is mango season, find some good Ataulfo mangos
    June-August: 
        look for Kent (early summer) or Kiett (arrives later in the summer usually) 
    September-November: 
        this is the hardest time to find good mango. the mexican season ends, and brazillian imports begin.  
        if you can't find Kiett or Palmer, see if you can find frozen mango that isn't Tommy Atkins. 
    December-February
        Kent (shipped in from Peru) is the best bet. you might find Atualfo but they may be too sour

For pineapple get an MD2 Gold hybrid, usually marketed as "gold" or "extra sweet". 
    pineapples ar available year-round. 
    
    smell the base of the fruit. ensure there's no smell of vinegar or fermentation. it should smell sweet & floral. 
    the leaves should be green & difficult to pull out. 
        brown, withered leaves indicate the fruit was in cold storage too long, causing internal browning & flavor loss. 
    tapping the side of teh fruit should cause a dull, sold sound. A hollow sound suggests the fruit is dried out. 


Jicamas are often coated in piraffin wax to prevent moisture loss. However, they can still dry out. 
    Choose a small to medium one. Large ones tend to be woody and fibrous. 
    Scratch the skin. The flesh underneath should be white and moist. If it is dry or yellow, put it back. 

    The skin of Jicama, along with the vines and leaves, contain rotenone, a toxic insecitcide. 
        It is imperative to peel the jicama, thoroughly, removing not just the skin but the fibrous sub-layer beneath it. 

The onion will need to be deflamed. 
    Soaking the diced onion in ice water with salt and lime juice extracts the sulfur compounds 
    and chemically cooks the onion slightly (denaturation) mellowing its flavor to a sweet, crispy savory one.

Cotija is salty, dry, and crumbly. It's sometimes called the Parmesean of Mexico. 
    Ensure the Cotija is block or de la Sierra. 
    Don't get the pre-crumbled bags, they're often coated in wood pulp to prevent caking, which creates a powdery texture. 
    grating or crumbling a fresh block yields the moist, irregular sized cheese of superior texture. 

most commercial chamoy consists of salt, chili powder, citric acid, red dye, and sodium benzoate. 
    our homemade one will be much superior. 
    it will consist of dried apricots, prunes, dried hibiscus flowers, and tamarind. 

likewise US chili powder is typically a blend of paprika, cumin, and garlic mainly suited for meats. 
    this is insuitable for fruit. 
    ours will be a grind of toasted ancho and guajillo chilis. 


Ensalada de frutas is a layered cup. This serves a functional purpose. 
    The liquid (orange and lime juice) is poured over the top after the cup is filled. 
    gravity pulls the juice down through the gaps in the fruit, carrying seasoning from the upper layers to the lower ones. 
    pre-tossed, the salt would draw moisture out of the fruit immediately, resulting in a pool at the bottom and soggy fruit.

NOTEWORTHY EQUIPMENT
==============================================

spice grinder 
sharp knife 
sieve
scale

==============================================
INGREDIENTS
==============================================

mango, 2 large, kent or ataulfo variety
pineapple, 1/2, gold variety (should smell sweet at the base, not fermented)
jicama, 1 lbs (sizes vary - scratch skin & make sure it's white, not yellow)
red onion, 1/4 medium 
fresh mint, 1/2 cup
cotija aged cheesee, 8 oz, block form (Cacique or similar)

orange juice, 1 cup, freshly squeezed (~3 oranges)
lime juice, 1.5 tbsp, freshly squeezed (~2 limes)
ancho chiles, 2
guajillo chiles, 2 

dried hibiscus, 1/2 cup 
dired apricots, 1/2 cup, unsulfered
prunes, 1/4 cup, pitted

tamarind paste or concentrate, 2 tbsp 
sugar, 2 tbsp
salt, 3 tsp
agave nectar, 2 tbsp

==============================================
PREPARATION
==============================================

1) make the chili powder 
    a) wipe clean 2 ancho chiles and 2 guajillo chiles. remove stems and seeds. 
    b) heat a dry skillet over medium heat. 
    c) press the chili skins flat against the skillet with a spatula. 
        toast for 30-60 seconds per side until they become fragrnat and slightly ligher in color. 
        do not let them smoke or blacken, they will turn bitter. 
    d) cool until crisp, then grind into a fine powder in a spice grinder. 
    e) mix with 1 tsp sea salt

2) make the chamoy 
    a) in a saucepan combine 1.5 cups water, 1/2 cup hibiscus flowers, 1/2 cup apricots, and 1/4 cup prunes. 
    b) bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 15-20 minutes until the fruit is very soft and rehydrated
    c) strain and separate the solids, but be sure to keep the liquid. 
    d) pick out the hibiscus flowers. you can discard the petals and keep the hibiscus fruit if you like
    e) placed the solids into a blender. 
        add 2 tbsp tamarind paste, 1/4 cup of the cooked liquid, 2 tbsp sugar, 1 tsp salt
        blend on high until smooth. 
        adjust consistency with cooking liquid as needed; it should coat the back of a spoon thickly.
    e) stir in 1 tablespoon of fresh lime juice and 1/2 teaspoon of chili powder. 
    f) allow it to cool completely 

3) deflame the onion 
    a) finely dice the red onion 
    b) prepare a bowl w/ 1 cup ice, 1 cup water, 1 tbsp lime juice, 1 tsp salt. 
    c) submerge the o nion in the ice bath for 15 minutes
    d) strain out and pat the onions dry with paper towels 
    
4) prepare the cheese 
    break the block of cotija into small crumbles using a fork or your hands 
        do not grate, you want nuggets of cheese. 

5) fruit dicing
    a) jicama - peel deeplly to remove the fibrous layer, slice into 1/4 inch cubes
    b) pineapple - remove skin and eyes, slice into 1/4 inch cubes
    c) mango - peel, cut cheeks away from the pit, slice into 1/4 inch cubes 

6) prepare the juice 
    combine the 1 cup orange juice, 1.5 tsp lime juice, and 2 tbsp agave nectar in a pitcher.
        agave has high solubility at cold temperature, and a neutral flavor that won't fight the fruit
        ensure you dont press the rinds too hard during juicing to avoid extracting bitter oils (limonin) from the white pith

7) combine the fruit + mint in a bowl
    a) toss together the diced mango, pineapple, jicama, and deflamed onion together to distribute them evenly. 
    b) slice the mint into thin ribbins & toss it in

===================================================
SERVING
===================================================

use 16-20oz clear cups 

you will create 3 layers: 
    1) Fill the cup 1/3 full with the fruit mixture. 
        drizzle 1 tsp of chamoy 
        sprinkle 1 tbsp of cotija 
        dust with 1/2 tsp chili powder. 
    2) add fruit to the 2/3 mark. 
        repeat chamoy, cotija, and chili 
    3) fill to the brim with fruit 
    4) pour the orange/lime juice over the fruit to fill the cup up half-way 
        do not drown the fruit, the juice is a dressing 
    5) top witih a generous mound of cotija cheese, sprinkle heavily with chili powder, and add a final drizzle of chamoy 
    6) if available, sprinkle dehydrated lime zest on top at the end

===================================================
MEAL COMBINATIONS
===================================================

for something simple: 
    - white corn tortilla chips w/ guacamole or ranchero refried beans. 
        ideally the chips should Xochitl brand, though Wegmans organic brand is also good
        for the beans try to get Siete Foods or A Dozen Cousins Refried Beans. 
        for the gaumacole try whole foods or homemade

    - a mexican frozen dinner with fat and protein: 
        - Del Real Foods Carnitas (can be found at Wegmans apparently)
        - Mole Poblano (Trader Joe's offers a frozen Chicken Mole) 
        - Green Chile & Cheese Tamales (Trader Joe's is supposed to have a good one)

===================================================
TEST RESULTS / ADJUSTMENTS
===================================================

First attempt turned out to be too sour. Some lessons learned:
    - I've adjusted the orange:lime ratio in the juice and added agave, which should go a long way
    - make sure you measure out the juice, to ensure you don't use too little orange juice 
    - make sure the fruit is ripe and in season, especially the limes / mangos
        infact, we should probably wait until spring / early summer to make this
    - do not ad-hoc add more lime than the recipe calls for, or add lemon juice, that's a mistake
    - don't go light on the jacima either, it's a neutral flavor which is needed. weigh it with a scale. 
    - be more generous with the chamoy / cotija 
    - you probably don't need to increase the size of the recipe
    - don't forget the mint, and be generous with it. it adds a cooling taste and contrast that's very good and needed. 

    - one issue may have been not tasting enough as I went along and adjusting sugar levels appropriately.
        fruit tends to vary in ripeness so this is probably an essential part of working with fruit.

    - the AI suggested possibly doubling the amount of prunes in the chamoy, or adding brown sugar, 
        but I dind't feel the chamoy was the issue so we'll see. 
        I suppose if the chamoy was sweeter it could offset other things, but I think the changes I've made are sufficient.
