BERRY YOGURT PARFAIT - DONE
===================================================

Greek yogurt is the base of the dish. Its high protein content (strained of weigh) provides the dish's structure. 
    True Greek yogurt differs from standard yogurt due to the centrifugation or filtration process, 
        which removes the acid whey (lactoserum), lactose, and soluble minerals.
    This concentrates the casein and milk fats, giving it lower moisture content and higher viscosity.
    
    At the PH of yogurt, casein proteins aggregate into a gel network. 
        This is desirable for stability but in a dessert context it can be not light enough / too pastey.
    
    Furthermore, the lactic acid provides a sharp tang.
        While necessary to cut the fruit sugar, an unmitigated acidic bite can be too much for a dessert.

    So our goal is to dilute the protein density with air (aeration) 
        and soften the acidity with lipids and sweeteners, 
        without destroying the tang that defines the dish.

    Heavy Cream (36–40% milk fat) will be added as the primary aeration vehicle. Yogurt doesn't foam well by itself.

        When heavy cream is whipped, air bubbles get trapped within. 
            Also, the membranes of the milk flat globules are stripped away by the shear force. 
                This exposes the fat crystals, which aggregate at the air-water interface, 
                fortifying the air bubbles and preventing them from coalescing or escaping. 
            Modern analysis has shown that combining the cream and yogurt before whipping is ideal. 
                The proteins in the yogurt interact with the free fat globules in the cream during whipping,
                creating a protein-lipid matrix that traps air even more efficiently. 

                Combining them also minimizes the risk of over-whipping the cream into butter. 
                    The non-fat solids in the yogurt physically impede the fat globules from clumping too aggressively. . 

    To prevent whey from leaking out of the yogurt over time, a high fat stabilizer is typically used. 
        Mascarpone Cheese (triple-cream cheese, ~70-75% fat) is what we will use.
        The high fat content will coat the casein network of the yogurt, 
            preventing the protein contraction that squeezes out water (whey) 
        Mascarpone also mitigates the astringency of the yogurt's acid.

Vanilla bridges the flavors of the dairy and fruit. 
    Vanillin and other volatile copounds in vanilla are fat-soluble. 
    By combining vanilla with the high-fat cream and mascarpone, the vanilla flavor is amplified and lingers longer. 

Honey or maple syrup are preferred as sweeteners, which integrate well into cold mixtures. 
    Granular sugar (sucrose) takes longer to dissolve in cold mixtures, risking grittiness. 
        It also can draw moisture out of the yogurt, increasing syneresis.


The fruit will be macerated. Maceration is the softening of food by soaking in a liquid or sugar. 
    Cooking destroys volatile esters and softens fruit through thermal degradation of pectin. 
    Maceration alters the texture through osmosis while preserving freshness. 
    
    When sugar is sprinkled on berries, it dissolves in the surface moisture. 
        It then draws intracellular water out of the berry, which will create a flavorful, naturally thickened syrup.
        Inside the berry turgor pressure drops, which tenderizes it.      

    The duration of maceration is critical to get right. 
        Too short and the fruit will remain firm / there will be minimal syrup formation.
        Too long and the fruit will become mushy and jam-like. 

        Our target will be 1-2 hours of maceration. 

Sumac has a tart, astringent flavor driven by malic, citric, and tartaric acids. 
    Sumac is used to add acidity without adding liquid volume / diluting the maceration syrup (the way that lemon would)
    This maintains a concentrated, intense syrup. 

    But we'll still add a small amount of lemon to control the PH, to prevent the berries from browning. 

Strawberries and basil both contain eugenol & other compounds (linalool, furaneol), making them a harmonious flavor pairing. 
    During maceration we'll add basil to the fruit mixture, and remove them before serving. This infuses the syrup with basil

We want to ensure the granola is neither too hard nor too soft. 
    Traditional granola relies on syrups (honey, maple) and neutral oil to bind oats. 
        This creates a too-hard, sticky cluster, and the oil isn't flavorful. 
    
    Instead we'll use egg whites and brown butter. 
    When egg whites are whipped to a froth and mixed with oats, the proteins coat the grains. 
        Upon baking, the water evaporates, and the proteins denature and coagulate, forming a rigid, crispy network. 
        This protein network is brittle. When bitten, it fractures instantaneously, providing a light, airy crunch. 

    By browning butter the water evaporates and the milk solids (proteins and sugars) undergo a Maillard reaction. 
        The Maillard reaction produces hundreds of new flavor compounds (pyrazines, furans) that mimic the flavor of toasted nuts. 

    To maximize the crunch, a small amount of starch (cornstarch or arrowroot) can be added. 
        The starch absorbs surface moisture and interacts with the egg whites to create a finer, crispier crust. 

    It's also important that we bake the granola at a lower temperature (300F-325f) for a longer period.
        High heat will burn the granola before the core of the oat cluster is fully dehydrated. 
        Low heat ensure complete dehydration, which is essential for crunch.  

This recipe also benefits from a temperature differential. 
    
    The dairy should be chilled (38F-40F) to maintain fat stability and foam structure. 
    
    The fruit should be brought to room temperature (68F-72F). 
        Volatile aromatic compounds in fruit are more active at room temperature. 
        Cold suppresses sweetness and fruitiness.

===================================================
PREPARATION 
===================================================

1) create the granola 
    a) brown the butter 
        a1) put 1/4 cup unsalted butter a small stainless steel saucepan over medium heat. 
        a2) swirl constantly. it will be foaming. 
        a3) at ~5-8 minutes watch for the milk solids at the bottom to turn a golden-brown color and emit a toasted aroma. 
                this can happen quickly so be ready, and know what to look for. 
                immediately pour into a bowl to stop the cooking.
        a4) let cool to around room temperature, though still liquid 

    b) make the coating
        b1) combine the 1 egg white & 1/2 tsp fine sea salt in a large bowl
        b2) whisk until frothy and opaque. 
            it does not need to reach soft peaks, but should be aerated foam. 
        b3) whisk the cooled brown butter, 1/3 cup maple syrup, and 1 tsp vanilla paste into the frothy egg white until fully combined 
    
    c) add the 2 cups oats, 1 cup sliced almonds, and 1 tsp cornstarch to the wet coating mixture
        toss thoroughly with spatula until everything is coated 
    
    d) line a baking sheet with parchment paper
        dump the granola onto the center 
        spread it out a little bit, but not into a single thin layer - it should still have some height, you want clusters. 
        press it down with the back of the spatula to compress the proteins 
    
    e) bake at 300F for 45-50 minutes 
        do not stir, that will break the protein bonds that form the large clusters 
    
    f) when done, place the pan on a wire rack and let it cool completely, at least for 45 minutes 
        as the sugars recrystallize and the proteins set it will harden into a rigid, crisp sheet. 
        then you can break it into large, irregular shards 


2) prepare the fruit (prepare 1-2 hours before serving) 
    a) place the strawberries, raspberries, and blackberries in a glass or ceramic bowl (non-reactive) 

    b) sprinkle the sugar, sumac, and salt over the berries. 

    c) drizzle them with lemon juice 

    d) gently toss, but be careful not to crush the raspberries 

    e) bury the whole basil sprigs in the berries 

    f) cover with plastic wrap and let sit at room temperature for 45 minutes to 2 hours 
        stir gently every 30 minutes. 

    g) taste a strawberry. once it's tender and translucent at the edges, it's ready. 
        remove and discard the basil sprigs
        now go make the yogurt mousse

3) make the yogurt mousse (prepare immediately before assembly) 

    a) get a bowl w/ a stand mixer w/ the whisk attachment
    b) place in it the ingredients all at once (this ensures the fat emulsifies within the yogurt protein network)
        1/2 cup mascarpone
        1/2 cupheavy cream
        1.5 cups greek yogurt
        3-4 tbsp honey
        1 pod's vanilla seeds (or 1.5 tsp vanilla bean paste) 
    c) whisk on low speed for 30 seconds to combine  
    d) increase speed to high for 2-4 minutes. 
        watch closely, the mixture will transition to soft peaks, then medium-stiff peaks. 
        it should hold it shape on the whisk but the tip should curl slightly 

        note: do not over-whip. if it become sgrainy, the fat is separating into butter. 
            if this happens, fold in a tbsp of cream to re-emulsify (not ideal) 

    e) keep chilled until the exact moment of assembly 

===================================================
SERVING
===================================================

1) get some tall clear glasses
2) fill the bottom with a generous layer of berries w/ syrup 
3) spoon in yogurt mousse over the fruit. 
    try to get the yogurt against the edges of the glass
4) spoon more berries on top of the yogurt mousse. 
    specifically drizzle a spoonful of syrup around the perimeter of the glass 
5) add a final layer of yogurt mousse, leaving about 1 inch of space at the top 
6) top generously with large shards of the granola 
7) add a small amount of sumac powder or a fresh basil leaf to the top at the end

===================================================
MEAL COMBINATIONS
===================================================

    - cold sliced salmon platter (figure out what to add here) 
    - bagel (pumpernickle bread or high end crackers were also options)
    - white tea 
    - sumac and lemon roasted asparagus
        - preheat oven to 400 
        - rinse the asparagus and snap off wooden ends 
        - toss the asparagus w/ 1-2 tbsp olive oil, 1-2 tsp sumac, salt & pepper 
        - cook for 10-12 minutes 
        - once they're done, squeeze fresh lemon juice over them & serve
