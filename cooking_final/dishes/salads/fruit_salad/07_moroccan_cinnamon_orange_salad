17. Moroccan Cinnamon Orange Salad: The Minimalist

Flavor Purity
This salad is a masterclass in minimalism. It typically features only one or two fruits—oranges and dates—but transforms them through spices and presentation.55
The Aromatics
•	Orange Blossom Water: A byproduct of distilled bitter orange blossoms, this water adds a floral perfume that is quintessentially Moroccan. It tricks the brain into perceiving sweetness and complexity without adding sugar.56
•	Cinnamon: A dusting of ground cinnamon on fresh oranges is a classic Moorish combination. The warmth of the spice contrasts with the cold, acidic juice of the citrus.57
•	Technique: The oranges are typically "supremed" (pith and peel removed) and sliced into rounds (carpaccio style) rather than chunks, changing the mouthfeel and presentation to something elegant and refined.57
