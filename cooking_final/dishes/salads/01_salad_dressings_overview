EMULSIFICATION
===========================================

When you shake, stir, or whisk a salad dressing you apply shearing force to the oil, 
    causing it to break into small droplets and disperse in the water. 

    If you gently stir or shake it the oil droplets will remain large, and will pool back together quickly, within a few minutes. 
    If you whisk it, blend it, or food process it, the resulting oil droplets will be very small and remain dispersed for longer. 

    This is why a vinaigrette whisked in a blender appears opaque and creamy, while a hand-whisked one appears translucent. 

To maintain an emulsion for more than a few minutes an emulsifying agent is used. 
    Emulsifying agents possess a dual nature - one end of the molecule bonds with water, and the other bonds with oil. 
    The emulsifying agent will coat the surface of the oil droplets and form a membrane. 
        This membrance acts as a physical and electrostatic barrier that keeps the oil droplets from coalescing. 


Emulsifier	        Active Agent	            Strength	                Application	
Egg Yolk	        Lecithin (Phospholipids)	High (Permanent)	        Mayonnaise, Caesar, Hollandaise	
Mustard	            Mucilage (Complex Carbs)	Medium (Semi-Permanent)	    Vinaigrettes, French Dressing	
Garlic/Onion	    Mucilage / Particulates	    Low/Medium	                Vinaigrettes, Toum	
Honey/Sugar	        Viscosity Modifier	        Low	                        Sweet Vinaigrettes, Poppy Seed	
Tomato Paste	    Pectin/Particulates	        Low/Medium	                French, Russian, Catalina	
Dairy Casein	    Milk Proteins	            Medium	                    Ranch, Blue Cheese


Temporary emulsion          cointains no emulsifiers, rely solely on shearing force. 
                                Will separate in under an hour, often in minutes. 

Semi-Permanent emulsion     contains a weak emulsifier or particulate matter (i.e. minced shallots). 
                                Will hold together for several hours or even a day

Permanent emulsion          contains a strong emulsifier, remain stable indefinitely or almost. 

===========================================
VINAIGRETTES 
===========================================

The vinaigrette should be understood as a formula: 
    Fat + Acid + Aromatics + Emulsifier

Traditionally, French vinaigrettes used a ratio of 3:1 oil to vinegar. 
    This ratio assumes olive oil and red wine vinegar (approx 5-7% acidity). 
    The fat buffers the acidity, creating a balanced mouthfeel that does not strip the palette. 

In Modern times many chefs have increased the acidity to ratios closer to 2:1 or even 1:1, 
    particularly when using sweeter acids (i.e. balsamic) or milder oils, 
    or when dressing robust bitter greens that can withstand a punchier attack. 
On the other hand, a harsh vinegar (i.e. distilled white wine) might require a 4:1 ratio. 

Lipids: 
    - Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) 
        It carries grassy, peppery polyphenols. 
        High-speed blending of EVOO can sheer these polyphenols, causing extreme bitterness. 
            So EVOO-based dressings should be hand-whisked.
    - Neutral Oils (Avocado) 
        Used when refrigeration is necessary (as they do not solidify like olive oil) or when the flavor of the acid is paramount.
    - Flavor Oils (Walnut, Sesame, Pumpkin Seed)
        These are often too potent to be the sole fat. 
        They are typically cut with neutral oil (e.g., 10% sesame, 90% canola) to provide aroma without overwhelming the palate.

Acids: 
    - Vinegars 
        - Red wine
        - white wine
        - champagne
        - sherry
        - Balsamic 
        - cider
        - rice
        
        Each brings a different pH and sugar profile
    
    - Citrus 
        - Lime 
        - Lemon 
        - Orange 

        provide fresh, floral acidity (citric acid) compared to the sharp bite of vinegar (acetic acid). 
        Citrus oxidizes rapidly. A lemon vinaigrette will lose its "pop" within 24 hours, 
            whereas a vinegar-based dressing can mature over days.

    - Pickle brine
    - sauerkraut juice

CREAMY DRESSINGS  
===========================================

Mayonnaise is an emulsion where the oil content can reach up to 80% by volume. 
    It's stabilized by lecithin from egg yolks. 
    
    Note that if oil is added too quickly the oil overwhelms the water before the lecithin can coat the droplets. 
        The result is a greasy, separated mess


===========================================
SALAD DRESSINGS LIST 
===========================================

Vinaigrettes: 
    - French Vinaigrette
        The chef first whisks the vinegar, salt, and Dijon mustard (and often minced shallots) together. 
        This "maceration" period allows the salt to dissolve (it will not dissolve in oil) and the shallots to mellow. 
        The oil is then streamed in slowly while whisking to form the emulsion.
    - Balsamic Vinaigrette
        This type of vinegar is already viscous, sweet, and complex, unlike the sharp watery wine vinegars. 
        Since it has a high sugar content and lower perceived acidity the oil:vinegar ratio is often 2:1 or even 1:1 
        often will be a semi-permanent emulsion using dijon 
        usually used with sturdy salads containing fruits (strawberries, figs), walnets, or heavy cheeses (gorgonzola). 
        May overwhelm delicate lettuces like mache 
    - Citrus Vinaigrette
        replaces vinegar with citrus juice. 
        contains water and sugar but lacks the complex organic compounds found in fermented vinegars that help to stabilize emulsions. 
        Hence these dressing separate faster than any other type. 
        lemon and lime juices oxidize rapidly, developing a cardboard flavor if stored more than 2-3 days. 
        So make these dressing fresh. 
        To combat the harshness of citric acid these dressing almost always require a sweetener (often honey, agave, or maple syrup). 
        People will often use a 1:1:1 ratio of acid:oil:sweetener here. 
    - Sherry Vinaigrette - often aged in oak barrels, in terms of flavor & complexity it sits between red wine & balsamic. 
        Has the sharp acidity of wine but the nutty, oxidized complexity of sherry. 
        pairs very well with nut oils (walnut or hazelnut oil) 
        and ingredients that have earthy or metallic profiles, such as beets, lentils, goat cheese, cured pork
        it's potent so it's often used in 3:1 or even 4:1 ratios
    - Honey-Lime Vinaigrette - Fresh lime juice, honey, neutral oil (avocado or canola), cilantro, and cumin.
        Because lime juice is intensely sour, the ratio often shifts to 1:1 (lime to oil) with a significant addition of honey.
        the high citric acid content is excellent for "massaging" raw kale to break down its cellulose structure, making it tender.

Creamy Dressings: 
    - Ranch - It's a thinned, seasoned mayonnaise. 
        The "Holy Trinity" of Ranch is Mayonnaise (fat/body), Sour Cream (tang/richness), and Buttermilk (fluidity/acidity)
        characterized by dried herbs (dill, parsley, chives) and alliums (garlic powder, onion powder). 
        Fresh herbs often fail to replicate the "Ranch" flavor, which relies on the concentrated punch of dried spices.
        control the thickness by adjusting the buttermilk ratio - less for a dip, more for a salad dressing
    - Caesar - It's a mayonnaise made with garlic-infused oil, egg yolks, and aggressive acids (lemon/lime)
        While the original recipe likely relied on Worcestershire sauce for umami, modern chefs use anchovy fillets or paste
        Further thickened and stabilized by the addition of grated Parmesan cheese, which acts as a particulate stabilizer
        Traditional recipes use raw egg yolks. Modern chefs often use pasteurized yolks or coddled eggs to mitigate salmonella risk
    - Blue Cheese - mayonnaise and sour cream, thinned with buttermilk.
        The acidity (lemon/vinegar) must be high to cut through the extreme richness of the cheese (Roquefort, Gorgonzola, or Stilton).
        The cheese acts as a thickener. The dressing must be made hours in advance to allow the cheese flavor to permeate the dairy base
        designed for structural greens like Iceberg.
    - Green Goddess - mayonnaise and sour cream (or yogurt) with massive quantities of fresh herbs: tarragon, chives, parsley, cilantro.
        Unlike Ranch, Green Goddess is defined by fresh chlorophyll and tarragon (anise flavor)
        It also traditionally includes anchovy paste
        Chefs often substitute avocado for some of the mayonnaise to create a vegan or "healthy fat" variation
    - Thousand Island or Russian dressing - mayonnaise tinted with ketchup or chili sauce (providing sweetness) 
         Texture is mandatory. Sweet pickle relish, minced onions, pimentos, and hard-boiled eggs are folded in.
        Russian dressing is typically spicier (horseradish/hot sauce) and less sweet, 
        while Thousand Island embraces the sweetness of the pickle relish. 


Emulsifications: 
    - Mayonnaise (Base Dressing)
        an emulsion of neutral oil, egg yolk, and acid (vinegar / lemon). mild, creamy, and stable. 
    - Authentic Aioli
        the name aioli name means (garlic and oil). 
        Traditionally it contains no egg, it's an emulsion created by crushing garlic 
            into a paste and slowly streaming in olive oil. 
        the garlic's mucilage acts as the emulsifier. 
        intensely pungent and heavy 
    - Mayo-based Aioli - a garlic mayonnaise that modern restaurants tend to use. 
        not as spicy as authentic aioli
    - French Remoulade
        A Mayonnaise based tartar sauce enriched with herbs (chervil, tarragon), capers, cornichons. 
        often serverd with celeriac or fried fish 
    - Cajun Remoulade - often contains little or no mayonnaise, it relies on creole mustard and oil instead. 
        Tinted red with paprika, ketchup, or hot sauce. Also contains horseradish and garlic. 
        It's spicy, acidic, and pungent. 
        Cuts through the richness of fried seafood and crawfish. 
Global Dressings: 
    - Miso Dressing (Japanese)
        Made with miso paste (fermented soybean), which acts as a stabilizer similar to mustard in traditional dressings. 
        Naturally thick, allowing chefs to create creamy dressings without oil. 
        The enzymes in raw miso can break down vegetables too early, so apply right before eating. 
    - Tahini Dressing (Middle Eastern)
        Equal parts tahini and water/lemon juice, fortified with garlic and cumin. 
        It is the standard sauce for falafel and heavy grain salads.  
    - Soy-Ginger Dressing (Modern version) - 
        A pureed suspension of raw vegetables (onion, celery, carrot, ginger) blended with vinegar and oil. 
        The vegetable fiber holds the oil in suspense, creating a thick, textures sauce. 
        It's an orange dressing. 
    - Soy-Giner Dressing (Traditional Japanese)
        A thin Vinaigrette made of soy sauce, rice vinegar, and vegetable oil (often with some sesame oil)
        Dark, salty, and umami-rich
    - Yogurt-Based Dressings (Indian Raita style)
        Yogurt is alerady acidic (lactic acid), so when substituting yogurt for mao you must reduce the other acids in the recipe. 
        Often used in "Green Goddess' variations where the tang of the yogurt compliments fresh herbs. 
    - Thai Peanut Dressing 
        It requires a rigorous balance of the five Thai tastes: Salty (Fish Sauce/Soy), Sweet (Sugar/Honey), 
            Sour (Lime), Spicy (Chili/Sriracha), and Bitter (Peanut).
        Like tahini, peanut butter requires warm water to thin it to a pourable consistency. 
        It is technically a suspension, not a true emulsion, as the peanut particles hold the mixture together.
    - Japanese Sesame Dressing (Goma Dressing)
        Toasted sesame seeds (ground into a paste), mayonnaise (often Kewpie brand, which is yolk-heavy), 
            rice vinegar, soy sauce, and sugar.
        The ground sesame seeds act as a stabilizer and thickener, creating a rich mouthfeel similar to a nut butter dressing

Sweet & Fruit-Based Dressings: 
    - Poppy Seed Dressing - a sweet and sour emulsion often associated with fruit or spinach salads. 
        the secret ingredient is grated onion or onion juice. Cuts through the high sugar content of the dressing. 
        Poppy seeds are too heavy to stay suspended in an oil/vinegar mix, so usually a thickener is added to these dressings. 
        This can be either a high ratio of sugar/honey (creating viscosity) 
            or a touch of mustard/mayonnaise. 
        Otherwise the seeds will sink to the bottom. 
    - Blackberry/Raspberry Vinaigrette
        variations often include herbs like basil or mint pureed with the fruit.
        A "secret ingredient" for fruit vinaigrettes is vanilla extract. 
            It bridges the gap between the savory oil and the sweet fruit, creating a cohesive flavor profile 
            that pairs exceptionally well with bitter greens and cheese

Novel Dressings: 
    
    - Hot Bacon Dressing
        Bacon is rendered until crisp and removed. The fat is kept hot in the pan. Vinegar, sugar, and mustard are whisked directly into the hot fat (often deglazing the fond).
        The boiling dressing is poured immediately over robust greens like spinach or dandelion.
        Typically relies on a 1:1 ratio of fat to vinegar, heavily sweetened with sugar to counteract the harshness of the hot vinegar fumes.
    - Egg Yolk Vinaigrette 
        (1 pint olive oil, 5 oz lemon juice, 1 Tbsp Dijon mustard, and 2 egg yolks)
        The egg yolks provide richness and a permanent emulsion stability that a standard vinaigrette lacks, 
            allowing it to cling to heavy leaves like kale or chard without sliding off 
    - Boiled Dressing
        Egg yolks, vinegar, sugar, mustard, and a starch (flour or cornstarch) are whisked together and simmered gently until thickened
        It contains little to no oil. The texture comes from the coagulation of egg proteins and the gelatinization of starch.
        It is tangy and sweet. Used as dressing for traditional potato salad, macaroni salad, and coleslaw. 
    - Seed Butters
        Recently people have tried using things like pumpkin seed butter or sunflower seed butter as the thickening base.
