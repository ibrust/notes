6.3. The Warm Contrast: Salade de Chèvre Chaud (Warm Goat Cheese)
A staple of the Parisian café lunch.
Ingredients:
•	Greens: Frisée or Arugula (peppery/bitter greens).
•	Cheese: 4 rounds of Crottin de Chavignol (or high-quality goat log).
•	Toast: Baguette slices.
•	Marinade: Olive oil, fresh thyme, black pepper.
•	Vinaigrette: 3 tbsp Walnut Oil, 1 tbsp Balsamic Vinegar, 1 tsp Honey.
Method:
1.	Marinate: Coat cheese rounds in oil and herbs. Refrigerate/freeze for 15 mins to firm up 
2.	Toast: Place cheese on bread. Bake at 375°F (190°C) for 8-10 mins until cheese is soft but holding shape. 
    Broil for 1 min to brown top 
3.	Dress: Toss the bitter greens with the walnut oil vinaigrette.
4.	Serve: Place the hot cheese toasts directly on the cold salad. The heat will release the aroma of the walnut oil.
