1) The Authentic Lebanese Tabbouleh (The Parsley Salad)
    Origin and Culinary Philosophy: There is perhaps no dish in the global culinary lexicon more misunderstood than Tabbouleh. 
        In Western supermarkets and delis, it is frequently presented as a grain salad—a heavy bowl of bulgur wheat 
        speckled with garnish-levels of parsley. This is a fundamental inversion of the dish's true identity. 
        As documented by culinary anthropologists and chefs like Claudia Roden and Yotam Ottolenghi, 
        authentic Tabbouleh is, without exception, a parsley salad. The bulgur exists merely to provide a textural 
        counterpoint, a "grit" that accentuates the softness of the herbs.   

    Flavor Architecture: The dominant flavor profile is an aggressive, verdant freshness driven by flat-leaf parsley, sharp lemon acidity, and the cooling sensation of spearmint. This is grounded by the savory, warming notes of baharat (Seven Spice) or allspice, which bridges the gap between the sharp citrus and the vegetal greens.   

    Ingredients & Sourcing:

    Parsley: Flat-leaf (Italian) parsley is non-negotiable; curly parsley lacks the requisite essential oil concentration. The quantity required is massive—often 3 to 4 large bunches for a standard bowl.   

    Mint: Fresh spearmint leaves, stripped from the stem.

    Bulgur Wheat: Fine grade (#1) is essential. Coarse bulgur disrupts the delicate texture.

    Tomatoes: Firm, ripe tomatoes, finely diced.

    Allspice/Baharat: A pinch of ground allspice or a Lebanese 7-spice blend adds the necessary aromatic depth.   

    Onions: Finely minced white onion or scallions (white and green parts).

    Technical Execution: The success of Tabbouleh rests entirely on moisture management and knife skills.

    The Chop: Herbs must be hand-chopped with a razor-sharp knife. Using a food processor bruises the leaves, causing them to oxidize and turn into a wet mash. The goal is a clean slice that retains the cell walls until mastication.   

    Osmosis Control: Tomatoes should be diced and pre-salted in a colander to draw out excess water before being added to the salad. This prevents the dreaded "soupiness" that plagues amateur attempts.   

    Bulgur Prep: The fine bulgur does not need boiling; it is traditionally soaked in fresh lemon juice or the drained tomato water, allowing it to absorb flavor as it rehydrates.   

    Copilot's version: 
    Description:
    A Levantine classic where parsley is the star, supported by mint, tomatoes, scallions, and a hint of bulgur. The salad is bright, lemony, and intensely herbaceous—the gold standard for herb-forward salads.
    Ingredients:
    - 4 cups flat-leaf parsley, finely chopped (leaves only)
    - 1 cup fresh mint leaves, finely chopped
    - ½ cup fine bulgur wheat (or quinoa for gluten-free)
    - 4 medium ripe tomatoes, diced and drained
    - 4-5 scallions (green onions), finely sliced
    - 1 medium cucumber, peeled, seeded, and diced (optional)
    - ¼ cup fresh lemon juice (about 2 lemons)
    - ⅓ cup extra virgin olive oil
    - 1 teaspoon sea salt (plus more to taste)
    - ½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
    - ¼ teaspoon ground allspice (optional, for authentic flavor)
    Preparation Steps:
    - Soak the Bulgur: Rinse bulgur in cold water, then soak in just enough water to cover for 20 minutes. Drain thoroughly, pressing out excess moisture.
    - Chop the Herbs: Use a sharp knife to finely chop parsley and mint. Remove tough stems; herbs should be almost fluffy in texture.
    - Prepare the Vegetables: Dice tomatoes and cucumber into small, even pieces. Drain tomatoes to prevent excess liquid.
    - Mix the Salad: In a large bowl, combine herbs, bulgur, tomatoes, cucumber, and scallions.
    - Dress: Whisk together lemon juice, olive oil, salt, pepper, and allspice. Pour over the salad and toss gently.
    - Rest: Let the salad rest for 15–30 minutes to allow flavors to meld. Taste and adjust seasoning.
    - Serve: Traditionally served with crisp romaine leaves or pita for scooping.
    Chef’s Tips:
    - The herb-to-bulgur ratio should be at least 4:1—tabbouleh is a green salad, not a grain salad.
    - Use only the leaves of parsley and mint for the best texture.
    - For gluten-free, substitute cooked and cooled quinoa for bulgur.
