Turkish recipe

Gavurdagi Salatasi (The Spoon Salad)
Origin and Culinary Philosophy: Named after the Gavurdağı mountains in southeastern Turkey, this is the most famous of the "spoon salads" (kaşık salatası). Like the Shirazi salad, it is finely chopped, but it is richer, nuttier, and more savory. It is designed to yield a copious amount of "juice" (a mixture of tomato water, oil, and molasses) that is scooped up with the vegetables.   

Flavor Architecture: The flavor is dominated by the interplay of sweet tomatoes, tannic walnuts, and the deep, sweet-sour tang of pomegranate molasses. It is a "umami bomb" of the salad world, especially when spicy pepper paste is included.   

Ingredients & Sourcing:

Walnuts: A massive quantity is used. They should be hand-crushed (not ground) to provide a coarse, meaty texture.

Pomegranate Molasses: High quality is essential—it should be 100% reduced pomegranate juice, not syrup with added sugar.

Tomatoes & Cucumbers: Finely diced.

Sumac: For astringency.

Spicy Pepper Paste (Acı Biber Salçası): A teaspoon is often whisked into the dressing.   

Technical Execution: The walnuts act as a thickener for the dressing, emulsifying with the oil and molasses to coat the vegetables. This salad improves with 15-20 minutes of resting time, allowing the flavors to meld and the juices to release.

Another version: 

Turkish Spoon Salad with Feta (Ezme-Style Variation)
Origin and Culinary Philosophy: A variation of the Gavurdagi, this version incorporates brined cheese (Beyaz Peynir or Feta) and focuses on the "mash" (ezme) texture. It is often served as part of a breakfast spread or appetizer course.

Flavor Architecture: Salty, acidic, and spicy. The cheese provides a creamy salinity that contrasts with the crisp vegetables.

Ingredients & Sourcing:

Feta Cheese: Crumbled into small nubbins.

Green Peppers: Turkish long peppers (Sivri Biber) are traditional, but bell peppers work.

Parsley: Generous amounts.

Technical Execution: The vegetables are chopped so finely they almost resemble a relish. The dressing is simple—lemon and olive oil—letting the cheese season the salad.
