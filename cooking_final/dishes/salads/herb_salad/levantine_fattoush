Fattoush (The Bread and Sumac Salad)
Origin and Culinary Philosophy: Fattoush belongs to the family of fattat—dishes built upon a foundation of stale flatbread. It is a salad of thrift, designed to utilize leftover khubz (pita). However, in the hands of masters like Sami Tamimi, it becomes a study in textural contrast. While the vegetable components are flexible and seasonal (making it a "garden salad"), the triad of stale bread, sumac, and acid is immutable.   

Flavor Architecture: The profile is defined by "sourness" in multiple dimensions: the citric acidity of lemon, the astringent tang of sumac (Rhus coriaria), and the deep, balsamic-like sweetness of pomegranate molasses. This acidity cuts through the richness of the fried bread and olive oil.   

Ingredients & Sourcing:

The Bread: Stale pita bread, torn into jagged shards (not cut into perfect squares), and deep-fried or oven-toasted until golden brown.

Sumac: Ideally sourced from a Middle Eastern grocer to ensure it is fresh and vibrant purple, not brown and oxidized.

Purslane (Bakleh): A succulent weed with a lemony snap, traditionally included for its textural pop.   

Vegetables: Radishes, cucumbers, tomatoes, and scallions.

Pomegranate Molasses: A modern standard addition for depth.   

Technical Execution: The "Fattoush-ish" concept implies variability in the greens, but rigor in the dressing. The bread serves as a sponge. If dressed too early, the bread dissolves; if dressed too late, it remains hard. The salad must be tossed immediately before service (à la minute) to ensure the bread is soaked on the exterior but crunchy in the center.
