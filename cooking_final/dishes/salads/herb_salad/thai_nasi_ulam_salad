Southeast asian recipe

4.4 The Forager's Challenge: Nasi Ulam (Nyonya Herb Rice)
Origin & Philosophy:
Nasi Ulam is the pinnacle of the Southeast Asian herbal salad. It is technically a rice salad, but the rice is merely a canvas for a massive quantity of herbs (Ulam). Originating from the Peranakan (Straits Chinese) communities of Malaysia and Singapore, it requires the most prep work of all. It is a room-temperature dish, often served at celebrations.
The "Kerisik" Factor:
Like Larb, this dish relies on a toasted element. Kerisik is fresh grated coconut, toasted in a dry wok until dark brown and oily, then pounded into a paste. This provides a smoky, nutty richness that coats every grain of rice.24
Ingredients:
•	Base: 3 cups Cooked Jasmine Rice (cooled to room temperature—warm rice will wilt the herbs).
•	The Umami Bomb:
o	1/2 cup Dried Shrimp (soaked, toasted dry, and pounded to floss).
o	1/2 cup Salted Fish (fried and pounded), optional but authentic.26
o	1/2 cup Kerisik (Toasted Coconut Paste).
•	The "Ulam" (The Herbs) - All Finely Chiffonaded:
o	10 leaves Daun Kaduk (Wild Betel).
o	10 leaves Daun Kesom (Laksa Leaf).
o	1 Turmeric Leaf (Daun Kunyit).
o	4 Kaffir Lime Leaves.
o	1 stalk Lemongrass (tender inner white part only), micro-sliced.
o	1 Torch Ginger Flower (Bunga Kantan), finely minced.
o	1/2 cup Thai Basil.
o	1/2 cup Mint.
Execution:
1.	The Rice Prep: Ensure rice is cool and grains are separate.
2.	The Mixing: In a very large bowl, combine the rice with the pounded dried shrimp, salted fish, and Kerisik. Rub the mixture with your hands to coat the grains evenly. The rice should turn a speckled brown color.
3.	The Herbal Infusion: Add the mountain of sliced herbs. Using your hands, toss gently to distribute.
4.	Seasoning: Season with salt and white pepper. Some versions add a squeeze of lime, but traditional Nyonya versions often rely on the herbs and salt fish for flavor.
5.	Serving: Serve at room temperature. This is not a hot dish.
Insight: This recipe is a test of knife skills. The finer the herbs, the more surface area releases oils into the rice. It is meditative cooking at its finest.
