BEET GOAT CHEESE SALAD - DONE
===================================================

- beets provide sweetness & earthiness.
    they have high sucrose content (brix). they also contain geosmin, which gives them an earthly aroma
    roasting them caramelizes their sugars, tenderizes their tough cellulose, 
        and manages the intensity of geosmin to ensure their earthiness is not overpowering

    red beets contain the highest concentrations of betacyanins (a betalain), geosmin, and sugar.
        this makes them the most flavorful.
        they have a robust, intense sweetness that stands up well to strong vinegars and pungent cheeses.
        when using them try to prevent their color from bleeding onto other ingredients, dying the whole dish red.
    golden beets contain betaxanthins (another betalain) instead of betacyanins.
        they are significantly milder, sweeter, and less earthy than red beets.
        some people say they're reminiscent of honey or roasted carrot.
    in our recipe we use 50/50 of both red and golden beets.
        this maximizes flavor complexity (robust earthiness vs. delicate sweetness)
    
    we will roast our beets. this concentrates the sugars and creates a maillard reaction.
        there are 2 roasting techniques we'll use:
        1) steam roasting (in aluminum foil)
            this creates a pressurized, moist environment that accelerates the breakdown of hemicellulose and pectin.
            the high ambient temperature also promotes flavor concentration.
            the beets will remain moist but not waterlogged.
            afterwards the skins will slip off easily due to the steam loosening the connective tissue

        2) salt roasting (burrying the beets in a bed of salt & encasing them in a salt crust)
            the bed of salt acts as a thermal buffer, modularing heat entering the beat.
                this prevents the outsides from burning or drying out before the inside is done
            salt also attracts water, drawing it out from the beet & concentrating the flavors / preventing sogginess
            as the beat sweats, a brine forms with the salt on the outside, which will season the beet.

            the salt crust consists of salt and egg whites. 
                as the salt heats, the water in the egg whites evaporates, leaving behind coagulated proteins. 
                these proteins bind the salt together, creating a superior seal. 
                some recipes use water for the crust, but the crust will be more fragile and prone to breaking that way.

        golden beets are more delicate and prone to drying out, so we will use the steam roasting method. 
        red beets have a more robust flavor profile that benefits more from the salt roasting method. 

        we'll add a splash of orange juice (acid) to the golden beet's pouches. 
            this will season them, but also stabilize their anthocyanins and betalains.

- whipped goat cheese provides tanginess & lipids.

    Fresh goat cheese is preferred over aged for this recipe due to its high moisture content, acidity, and spreadability. 
    Goat cheese gets it tanginess from caproic, caprylic, and capric acids (short-chain fatty acids) 
        this tartness will bridge with the acidity of the vinaigrette. 
    to reduce the cheese's heaviness & density we'll whip it and add in heavy cream. 
        whipping denatures proteins & traps air bubbles, while cream stabilizes the mixture. 
        whipping also gives us a chance to season the cheese w/ honey, black pepper, & lemon zest. 

- pistachios provide a toasted flavor, oleaginous richness, and contrasting texture 

    Roasting pistachios releases volatile oils within the nut matrix, significantly boosting aroma. 
        it also reduces moisture content, making the cell walls brittle & crunchy. 

- sherry vinaigrette cuts through the fat of the goat cheese. 
    while balsamic vinegar is a common household choice for beets, it is often too sweet, 
    especially when paired with roasted beets that have already concentrated their sugars. 
    
    sherry vinegar is preferred by culinary authorities for beet salads. 
        It has a distinct nuttiness and complex oxidative quality derived from aging, 
            which parallels the earthiness of the beets and the toastiness of the pistachios. 
        It offers a sharper acid profile than balsamic but is more complex than red wine vinegar or cider vinegar. 

    fresh orange juice and zest are used to lift the deep flavors of sherry vinegar and beets. 
        The essential oils in the zest (limonene) provide an aromatic lift. 
        The sweetness bridges the gap between the vinegar and the beets
    
    a high-quality EVOO with grassy, peppery notes complements the arugula. 
    to reinforce the nutty element of the salad, using 25-30% walnut oil adds depth

- bitter greens (arugula, radicchio) help to cleanse the palate / cut through the fat of the goat cheese. 
    sweet greens would be lost against the density of the beets. 


===================================================

- fresh herbs (picked leaves of tarragon, mint, dill in about a 2:3:5 ratio), 1/2 cup

===================================================
PREPARATION 
===================================================

1) prepare the beets for roasting:
    a) trim the beets but leave about 1 inch of root attached, and leave the root intact. 
        if you were to cut the beet open it would leak during steaming and lose flavor 
    b) soak and scrub the beets to get any dirt off, so that the dirt doesn't turn to mud and soil the flavor 

2) roast the beets 

    - if using the tin foil method: 
        preheat oven to 400F 
    
    - if using the salt crust method: 
        preheat oven to 425F

    - if doing both tin foil & salt crust: 
        preheat overn to 425F 
        put the salt-roasted beets in 15 minutes earlier 
        put the tin foil beets on the coolest rack 
        add 1 tbsp of water to the tin foil packet before sealing 
            this ensures immediate steam generation, which will prevent sugars from scorching early on.
        cook the salt crusted beets for a about an hour, and the tin foil beets for about 45 min / check for doneness

    a) to salt roast the red beets
        a1) in a bowl mix the salt and egg whites until the mixture resembles wet sand. 
            the ratio of salt to egg white will depend on the type of salt used. 
                for diamond crystal kosher salt, use a 3:1 ratio 
                for morton kosher salt, use a 1.75:1 ratio
        a2) pack the mixture tightly around each red beet until completely encased.
        a3) place on a parchment-lined baking sheet.


    b) to foil roast the golden beets
        b1) coat the beets in either light olive oil or avocado oil, about 1 tsp - 1 tbsp per beet
        b2) wrap the beets together in a pouch of foil.
                add 4 sprigs fresh thyme, and 1 strip orange zest 
        b3) fold the foil tightly to seal it off. if steam escapes the beets will dry out. 
                if necessary you can double wrap to ensure no steam escapes. 

    c) cook for the correct amount of time 

        for foil at 400F: 
            small beets     30-40 minutes cooking time
            medium beets    45-60 minutes
            large beets     60-75 minutes

        for salt crust at 425F: 
            small beets     45-55 minutes cooking time
            medium beets    60-75 minutes
            large beets     75-90 minutes

        salt-crusted beets will continue cooking after removal from the oven. 
            this resting period of 10-15 minutes before cracking their crust is part of the cooking time. 
                this will finish off the core gently
        the foil beets you'll open immediately, you won't let them rest. 

2) Prepare the Pistachios: 
    a) toast 1 cup pistachios in a dry pan 

        AI thought over medium heat for 3-4 minutes. 
            but that turned out soft. 
            another part of the directions actually said 375F for 8 minutes. 
            but I see elsewhere saying pistachios can burn quickly... so maybe that's why 4 minutes was recommended. 
        maybe try 6 minutes of medium heat toasting next time and see how that goes, or do some deeper research...

    b) add 1 tbsp honey, 1/4 tsp cayenne, and 1/4 tsp salt. stir constantly for 1-2 minutes until nuts are glazed and sticky.
    c) pour the nuts onto parchment paper, separate them with a fork immediately, and let them cool / let the coating harden.

3) Start preparing the Vinnaigrette (beets are ~20 minutes from completion):
    a) combine the minced shallot, 3 tbsp sherry vinegar, 1 tbsp orange juice, and 1 pinch of salt in a small bowl. 
    b) Let stand for 15 minutes (removes the raw onion bite and dissolves the salt) 

3) Prepare the Whipped Goat Cheese (beets are ~15 minutes from completion): 
    a) place 8 oz goat cheese, 3 tbsp heavy cream, 1 tbsp honey, 1 tsp lemon zest, and 1 pinch black pepper in a food processor.
    b) whip on high for 1-2 minutes until the mixture is glossy, aerated, and spreadable
    c) transfer to the refridgerator for 20 minutes to set

4) Finish the Vinnaigrette (beets ~5 minutes until completion):
    a) whisk the 1 tsp dijon mustard, 1 tsp honey, and 1 tsp orange zest
    b) slowly stream in the EVOO and walnut oil while whisking vigorously 

5) Finish the dish (beets finishing)
    a) beet cooking time can vary depending on their size.
        When the golden beets are done a knife will slide through effortlessly
    b) crack the salt crust with the end of a knife. discard the salt.
        while the beets are warm, rub their skins off with a spare towel.
    c) cut the beets into smaller pieces.
    d) toss the red beets with the dressing in one bowl. 
    e) let the beets cool to room temperature in the dressing (warm beets abosrb flavor via expanded pores) 
    f) after the pistachios have cooled, chop about half of them (for textural variety)


===================================================
SERVING
===================================================

I'll probably ignore their plating suggestions and just make a bed of salad, add the beets on top, then the cheese, then the pistachios, and lastly the dressing.

You can also add a few orange wedges to the salad if there are any remaining. 


==============================================================
MEAL COMBINATIONS
==============================================================

for something simple: 
    - artisan walnut bread 
    - butternut squash soup 
    - smoked salmon (raw or cooked)
    - rosemary crackers & white bean dip 
    - chocolate cake 


===================================================
TEST RESULTS / ADJUSTMENTS
===================================================

- pistachios were still chewy, see if going longer than 4 minutes on medium heat is advised given that they may burn quickly. 
- need to figure out a better way of plating the cheese along with everything else 
- we needed a larger orange for zest, the smaller one did not produce good zest
- mandarin orange slices with it turned out very well 
- blender doesn't work for blending goat cheese.
    remember to leave goat cheese out to reach room temperature. 
    also remember to put the whipped goat cheese in the refridgerator to set. 
- it may be worth getting a softer brush for scrubbing the dirt off. I heard there's something called a potato brush
