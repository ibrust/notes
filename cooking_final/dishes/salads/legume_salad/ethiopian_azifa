Ethiopian Azifa (Chilled Lentil Salad with Lime & Spices): Azifa is a traditional Ethiopian green lentil salad that’s served cold. It’s loved for its refreshing, zesty character. Cooked green lentils are slightly mashed and mixed with ingredients like fresh lime juice, mustard, green chilies (or jalapeño), and warm spices such as turmeric and sometimes ginger. The result is a vibrant salad that’s “a bright, zesty counterpoint” to heavier dishes – tangy, lightly spicy, and very uplifting. Azifa is vegan and high in protein, traditionally enjoyed during Lent or as a light side dish year-round.
