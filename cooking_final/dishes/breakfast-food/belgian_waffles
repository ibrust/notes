here's the AIs recipe: 

Ingredients (makes about 8 waffles)

2 ¼ cups (270 g) all-purpose flour
1 packet (2 ¼ tsp) active dry yeast
2 tbsp granulated sugar
½ tsp salt
2 large eggs
2 cups (480 ml) warm milk (about 100°F / 38°C)
½ cup (115 g) unsalted butter, melted
1 tsp vanilla extract


✅ Instructions


Activate yeast:
In a large bowl, combine warm milk, sugar, and yeast. Let sit for 5–10 minutes until foamy.


Mix batter:
Add eggs, melted butter, vanilla, and salt. Whisk until combined.
Gradually add flour, mixing until smooth. Batter will be thin.


First rise:
Cover bowl with plastic wrap and let rise at room temperature for 1 hour, or until doubled.


Second rise (optional for extra flavor):
Refrigerate overnight for deeper flavor and crispier texture.


Cook waffles:
Preheat waffle iron. Lightly grease if needed.
Pour batter (about ½ cup per waffle) and cook until golden and crisp (usually 3–5 minutes).


Serve:
Top with powdered sugar, berries, whipped cream, or chocolate sauce.



✅ Pro Tips

For extra authentic flavor, use pearl sugar (like in Liège waffles) sprinkled into the batter before cooking.
Overnight fermentation gives a slightly tangy, complex taste.
