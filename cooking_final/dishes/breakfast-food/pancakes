DONE

- batter & ingredient tips: 
    - ensure fresh leaveners (baking soda, baking powder), which can lose their potency over time. 
        apparently baking powder also lowers the temp at which the maillard reaction occurs, helping with browning, but not when expired
    - some people have tried incorporating small amounts of melted butter into the pancake mix 
    - I saw one chef use a mix of baking soda and baking powder. he claimed the baking soda would react more quickly, giving him more bubbles early. another chef just used double baking powder, which seems more reliable to me, although I wonder if it could effect the batter flavor 

- cooking tips: 
    - use a non-stick ceramnic coated pan. a well seasoned carbon steel pan is also an option. 
    - use low to medium-low, consistent heat 
        (one chef recommended 300f, I need one of those heat guns to get it right)
    - do not press on the pancake with the spatula 
    - flip only once. wait until you start to see some bubbles across the surface, and the edges look dry 
    - use a wire rack to keep them warm. put the wire rack over a baking sheet in a 150F-200F oven. 
        putting them on a plate will make them steamy / soggy 
    - many chefs like the griddle alot 

- mistakes to avoid: 
    - a stainless steel pan is not ideal. it's hard to make it not stick, and if they stick they'll fall apart. 
    - some recommend recoating the pan with butter after every pancake to ensure it browns with butter 
        others recommend a light coating of butter. too much can create an uneven, oily texture apparently. 
        but Babbish / a few others say not to use butter at all, and only use it at the end. 
            He says it causes the first weird pancake because that pancakew ill absorb all the fat. 
            Apparently if the pan is non-stick you don't need the fat.  
            I like the idea of adding it at the end, because butter has a low smoke point. 
    - you need to preheat the pan. otherwise it'll stick a little bit, even to a non-stick pan... and it won't brown. 
    - make sure your heat is distributed evenly throughout the pan, so that the pancakes cook evenly. 
        it's a problem especially with square pans. 
        but generally, to prevent this, you preheat the pan slowly, i.e. on medium-low heat, so that it has time to distribute the heat evenly 
        it also helps if you move the pan around (if the pan shape requires it) 
        another solution is to just use a griddle, which will have an even heat distribution 
    - if the pan is too hot the pancake will look down on the outside (brown) but not done on the inside. lower the pan temp 
    - if you let the batter rest too long the leavener gets expended and goes flat. 
    - but if you don't let it rest enough it'll still have clumps, it won't be fully hydrated or fully mixed. 

    - make sure to get the ingredient ratios right. 
        if your batter has too much flour it'll be too thick and goupy. it'll be raw in the middle by the end. 
        too much sugar in the batter will cause the pancake to be too flat, it may stay liquidy
        too much milk and the batter will be too thin 
    - buttermilk pancake recipes rely on a baking soda leavener typically. 
        buttermilk has the acid for activating the baking soda. 
        if you don't add the acid or buttermilk it won't rise 
    
    - if you add butter to the pancake recipe make sure the ingredients are all room temperature. 
        otherwise when the cold ingredients mix with the melted butter they will resolidify the butter 
        you'll wind up with butter globs in the batter that will melt and you'll have holes in the pancakes 

_____________________________

our current goal is about 9% protein content for the flour. we may adjust if needed, we'll see. 

    AI actually has these recommendations, which kind of are exactly that: 

        50% All-Purpose + 50% Pastry Flour: Brings the protein content down to ~9-10%, ideal for fluffy but not overly delicate pancakes.
        75% All-Purpose + 25% Cake Flour: Slightly softer pancakes, still with good structure.
        Add-ins: A tablespoon of cornstarch per cup of flour can also reduce toughness and improve tenderness.

        It claims you want the protein % down to like 8-10% 

another interesting option is to use spelt. it has 9-12% protein, and is often used interchangeably with all-purpose flour. 

=======================================================
MAKING THE BATTER 
=======================================================

1) fully whisk dry ingredients together

2) fully whisk wet ingredients separately (maybe wait until the end to whisk and add the egg)

3) combine wet & dry gently, just until no dry streaks remain 
    (it took ~27 stirs when I tried it)
    scrape around the bottom to get pockets of flour
    as soon as you stop seeing dry flour stop mixing 
    good to use a glass bowl so you can see the flour 
    
4) let rest for ~15-30min. lumps are okay - they'll hydrate and smooth out during resting

5) the pancakes are done when you see bubbles, they pop and the hole remains (it doesn't dissolve) 

6) make sure you add salted butter to the pancakes while they're warm

7) you can put finished pancakes in a low oven (150-200) while cooking the rest 

note: pastry flour tends to absorb a bit less liquid, so your batter might be thinner.
        if it looks too runny reduce buttermilk by 1–2 tablespoons or add 1–2 teaspoons extra flour.

EXPERIMENTAL RECIPE NUMBERS
=======================================================

___________________________
My ideal derived recipe: 
1 cup flour (50/50 italian all-purpose and tip 00)
1.7 tbsp sugar
1.25 tbsp baking powder 
5/8 tsp salt 
1/2 tsp baking soda 

9/10ths cup buttermilk 
3 tbsp butter (melted, unsalted) 
1 large egg 
1.5-1.7 tsp vanilla extract (but I may lower this to 1 tsp next time)

AIs critiques: 
    Salt: 5/8 tsp is a little high for just 1 cup flour. Most recipes use ½ tsp per cup. 
        Yours is slightly above that, so pancakes may taste a bit salty.
    Baking Powder: 1.25 tbsp is on the upper end for 1 cup flour. 
        It should work, but if you notice a metallic or bitter aftertaste, reduce to 1 tbsp.
    Buttermilk: 0.9 cup is fine, but if batter feels too thick, you might need a splash more (up to 1 cup).
        (since I'm using tipo 00 the 0.9 actually makes sense / is consistent with AIs earlier recommendation)

My critiques after trying it: 
    Overall they were very good, but maybe we could improve a few things: 
    - We were at 1.5-1.7 tsp vanilla. I thought the pancakes may have had too much vanilla, 
        and I didn't put the entire amount in... I probably put 1.25 in. 
        Maybe try AIs recommendation of 1 tsp vanilla, or even less. 
        according to AI: 
            Most classic recipes use 1/2 to 1 tsp per cup of flour.
            1/2 tsp gives a subtle background note.
            1 tsp gives a clear vanilla flavor without overpowering.
            1.25 tsp is fine if you want a strong vanilla presence, but it’s edging toward dessert-like.
            If you want balanced flavor, go with 1 tsp.
            If you love vanilla-forward pancakes, keep 1.25 tsp.
            If you want the flour and buttermilk to shine more, drop to 1/2 tsp.
    - The batter felt almost too thick. However, that may have been why it rose so well. 
        I could try adding slightly more buttermilk next time... but I liked how the pancakes turned out. 
        They had incredible rise. So maybe I'll just cook them slower - our burners were on '4'. 
        I'll have to find out what temperature that is and adjust accordingly. Maybe try 3.5 next time. 
        I'd like to keep the batter ratio just due to the incredible amount of lift we got.
        If I am removing vanilla though I will need some more buttermilk... 
            maybe .95 cups makes sense. Although I don't think I got all 3 tbsp of butter in either.

___________________________
AIs "balanced" recommendation after looking at the other recipes:

1 & 1/4 cups flour (16g)                
1.5 - 2 tbsp sugar                      // for mild sweetness - not dessert-level
1 - 1.25 tbsp baking powder             // enough lift without bitterness. usually 1-1.25 per cup of flour 
1/2 - 5/8 tsp salt                      // flavor without overpowering - around 1/2 tsp per cup of flour
1/2 tsp baking soda                     // usually 1/2 tsp per cup of buttermilk

1 cup buttermilk 
2-3 tbsp butter (melted, unsalted)      // rich but not greasy
1 large egg 
1 tsp vanilla extract                   // pleasant aroma without dominating


=======================================================
RESTING THE BATTER 
=======================================================

Why let the batter rest if the baking powder is reacting once it gets wet? 
    because it'll react again when heat hits it, but letting the batter rest 
    allows the flour to fully absorb moisture and it allows the gluten strands to relax 
        letting the gluten strands relax is especially important if it was mixed too much. 
    also, small bubbles are still forming within the batter from the banking powder as it rests, they don't all dissipate, it's heavy batter. 
        but if you were to let the batter rest too long those bubbles would dissipate 

    ideal time to let the batter rest: ~15 min apparently. Babbish thinks 30 min... he's probably right. we'll go with 30 

=======================================================
AMOUNT OF STIRRING  
=======================================================

overmixing the battery actually creates 2 problems: 
    1) it overactivates gluten, causing a chewy pancake 
    2) it breaks up the bubbles released by the baking powder, reducing fluffiness
        thicker batters (like pancake batter) are more sensitive to bubble loss. 
        thinner batters (like crepes) can tolerate more mixing

Babbish says to stir or whisk lightly until you see no more dry ingredients 

=======================================================
PAN HEAT  
=======================================================

375F is the recommended heat according to AI, who cites America's test kitchen / Serious Eats 
    which matches medium-low to medium on most burners, apparently. 

    but this is above the smoke point of butter, which I find dubious 

    I saw one chef recommending NOT putting butter in the pan, but rather adding it afterwards... 

    another option is to use ghee 

whatever temperature we settle on will require an infrared thermometer, 
    or a griddle with a temperature setting

worth noting: 
    thicker batter may need a slightly lower heat to cook through fully 
    also, egg-rich or sugar-rich batters will burn easier, so use slightly lower heat 
    resting the batter also helps the pancake cook evenly 


=======================================================
MISC
=======================================================

for taste in our pancakes tupelo honey is recommended. Sidr is a potential alternative option. 
    YS BEE FARMS Raw Tupelo Blossom Honey is a good one

AI MODIFICATIONS TO MY RECIPE
=======================================================

1) Espresso pancake
        1 tsp espresso powder 
        reduce the amount of vanilla extract to 1/2 tsp
        a pinch of cinnamon 
        drizzle ganache on top (chocolate sauce, research how to make)

2) chia pancakes 
        1 tbsp chia seeds in the batter (hydrated in liquid for best texture)
            Mix 1 tbsp chia seeds with 2 tbsp water or buttermilk. Let sit for 10 minutes until gel-like. This prevents crunchiness and adds moisture.
        1/2 tsp cardamom
        1/4 cup chopped pecans  in the batter
        A drizzle of honey or maple syrup in the batter for subtle sweetness 
        Top with fresh berries, a dollop of Greek yogurt, and a drizzle of honey for a wholesome finish.

3) orange zest pancakes 
        1 tsp finely grated orange zest (from a fresh orange)
        1 tbsp fresh orange juice (boosts citrus flavor without thinning too much)
        Pinch of cinnamon (pairs beautifully with orange)
        Put orange segments on top, along with maple syrup - apparently they will pair well 

Other ingredients AI could flesh out a recipe around: 
    - Crushed cookies 
    - chopped pecans 
    - rolled oats 
    - Fresh berries (blueberries, raspberries, strawberries)
    - Banana slices
