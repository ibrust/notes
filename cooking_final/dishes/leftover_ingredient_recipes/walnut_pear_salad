A simple way of using up leftover walnut oil. 


walnut oil, 2 tbsp
extra virgin olive oil, 4 tbsp 
sherry vinegar, 2 tbsp
dijon mustard, 1 tsp
baby arugula 
2 ripe pears 
blue cheese, crumbled gorgonzola or roquefort
    goat cheese is a permissible substitute
walnut halves 1/2 cup 
1 shallot 
1 lemon 
1/4 tsp salt 
black pepper

1) toast the walnuts 
    place 1/2 cup of walnut halves in a small, dry skillet over medium heat.
    cook for 3-5 minutes, shaking the pan frequently 
    remove when you smell a strong nutty fragrance. do not wait for them to darken significantly, since they'll be burned. 
    transfer to a cool place to stop the cooking

2) macerate the shallot (neutralizes the sulfur compounds in the shallot) 
    peel and finely mince the shallot 
    put 1 tbsp in a bowl where your salad will be mixed
    add 2 tbsp of sherry vinegar
    add 1/4 tsp salt 
    let sit for 5-10 minutes

3) soak the arugula, & completely dry it using a salad spinner / towels 

4) create the vinaigrette 
    add 1 tsp dijon mustard to the shallow/vinegar mix 
    continuously whisk in 2 tbsp walnut oil / 4 tbsp olive oil 
    add black pepper

5) prepare the fruit 
    cut pears in half, core them, & slice into thin wedges 
    squeeze half a lemon over the slices and toss gently to coat (prevents browning / adds flavor)

6) place the arugula in a large bowl 
    drizzle 3/4 of the dressing over it 
    toss the salad 
    arrange the pear slices on top of the greens 
    scatter the walnuts and crumbled blue cheese over the top 
    drizzle the remaining dressing over it
