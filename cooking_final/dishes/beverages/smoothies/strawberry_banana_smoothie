The Intense Strawberry-Banana Smoothie with Jam
While strawberry-banana is the most ubiquitous smoothie combination, it often suffers from "flavor thinness" due to the high water content of commercial berries. The Serious Eats approach addresses this through a two-stage strawberry delivery system that qualifies it as a master recipe contender.5
The formulation calls for 1.5 cups of frozen strawberries, which are typically harvested and processed at peak seasonal ripeness, ensuring a more concentrated berry profile than fresh supermarket alternatives.5 The innovation in this recipe is the inclusion of one tablespoon of high-quality strawberry jam.5 This serves a dual purpose: it provides a concentrated hit of berry flavor that bridges the gap between the frozen fruit and the milk, and it introduces additional pectin, which acts as a natural thickener to create a "sippable version of strawberries and cream".5
From a practicality standpoint, this recipe is highly resilient. It can be prepared with dairy-free milk alternatives if necessary, although whole milk is recommended for the highest degree of richness.5 The banana functions as the primary thickening agent, while the milk provides the necessary liquid solvent to create a "rich, velvety consistency" that is reminiscent of childhood strawberry milk without artificial additives.
