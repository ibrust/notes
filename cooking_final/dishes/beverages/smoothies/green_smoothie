The Martha Stewart Favorite "Blended Green Juice"
Martha Stewart’s founder-favorite green beverage is a candidate for the master recipe because it bridges the gap between juicing and blending, providing the fiber and nutrition of a smoothie with the refreshing clarity of a juice.28
The "cocktail" of ingredients includes celery, parsley, pears, orange, cucumber, and fresh ginger.28 By blending these instead of juicing them, the home chef retains the dietary fiber found in the pear and cucumber skins.28 The pear provides a delicate sweetness that is less aggressive than apple, allowing the ginger and parsley to shine.28
The practicality of this recipe is found in its versatility; ingredients can be mixed, matched, and swapped based on what is available in the crisper drawer.28 It is an "immune-boosting treat" that is particularly effective for hydration due to the high water content of the cucumber.
