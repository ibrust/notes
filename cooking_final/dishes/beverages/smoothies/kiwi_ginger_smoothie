The Food Network Kiwi-Ginger Zinger Protein Smoothie
The "Kiwi-Ginger Zinger" is a candidate for the master designation because it focuses on "clean" flavors and high protein content without the use of animal products or heavy powders. It provides 16 grams of protein and 5 grams of fiber per serving.24
The recipe blends two ripe kiwis with a one-inch piece of fresh ginger, 3/4 cup of light coconut milk, and 1/4 cup each of fresh parsley and raw shelled hemp seeds.25 The ginger provides a thermogenic warmth and a sharp "zinger" effect, while the parsley adds a bright, herbaceous note that cuts through the richness of the coconut milk.25
The use of hemp seeds is a highly practical way for the home chef to add protein; they blend into a creamy consistency much more easily than larger nuts or seeds and do not require pre-soaking.25 This is a "clean-tasting" smoothie that appeals to those who prefer tart, refreshing, and energizing flavor profiles.
