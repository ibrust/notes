Jamie Oliver’s "Staying Power" Frozen Fruit Smoothie
Jamie Oliver’s approach to the smoothie is defined by nutritional density and "staying power." His formulation is a master candidate because it introduces dry pantry goods—specifically oats and nuts—to provide a slow-release energy profile.17
The recipe combines one ripe banana and one glass of frozen fruit (strawberries, mango, or blackcurrants) with two heaped tablespoons of natural yogurt.17 The innovation is the addition of a small handful of quick-cook oats and a small handful of mixed nuts.20 The oats provide soluble fiber that slows the absorption of fruit sugars into the bloodstream, while the nuts add protein and healthy fats.18
Practicality is a hallmark of this recipe. Jamie Oliver specifically advocates for frozen fruit because it is harvested at peak ripeness and remains "cheaper and far more convenient" than fresh produce.20 For the home chef, this formulation represents the ultimate "quick breakfast on the go" that can sustain an individual until lunchtime
