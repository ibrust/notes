The Levantine Nectar: Qamar al-Din
7.1 The Apricot Leather Tradition
Qamar al-Din is the definitive Ramadan beverage of the Levant (Syria, Lebanon, Jordan). It is made from dried apricot paste (leather), known as Amardeen. This ingredient is produced by boiling apricots with sugar and olive oil, then sun-drying them into sheets. This process concentrates the flavor, caramelizing the sugars and altering the chemical profile of the fruit. The resulting drink is thick, luscious, and possesses a depth of flavor—notes of dried fruit, honey, and flowers—that fresh apricot juice cannot match.29
7.2 Rehydration Dynamics
The "master" technique involves patience. Boiling the leather to dissolve it is possible but discouraged, as it can cook off the volatile aromatics. The preferred method is a long, cold soak, followed by blending. This preserves the fresh, floral notes of the apricot while ensuring a smooth texture.31
7.3 The Master Recipe: The Floral Infusion
Ingredients:
Qamar al-Din Sheet: 1 package (400g). Look for brands from Syria or Lebanon (e.g., Ziyad, Al-Wadi), which typically use the Mishmish variety of apricots known for intense flavor.32
Water: 4-6 cups (hot, but not boiling).
Sugar: Optional. The paste is often sweetened, but extra sugar may be needed depending on the brand.31
Orange Blossom Water: 1 tsp. This is the signature addition that elevates the drink from "fruit juice" to an elegant beverage.29
Pine Nuts: 2 tbsp, soaked in water for 1 hour (for garnish).
Preparation Protocol:
Breakdown: Tear the apricot leather sheet into small pieces (approx 1-inch squares). The smaller the pieces, the faster the dissolution.29
The Soak: Place the pieces in a bowl and cover with the warm water. Let sit for at least 4-6 hours, or ideally overnight in the fridge. The paste will dissolve into a thick, orange sludge.31
Blending: Pour the mixture into a blender. Blend on high until completely smooth. There should be no lumps. Adjust consistency with more cold water if it is too thick (it should coat the back of a spoon, like a nectar).31
Aromatizing: Stir in the orange blossom water. Do not blend the flower water, as high-speed aeration can dissipate the aroma.
Service: Serve extremely cold. Top each glass with a spoonful of the soaked pine nuts. The resinous crunch of the pine nuts against the sweet, viscous apricot is a classic textural pairing.
