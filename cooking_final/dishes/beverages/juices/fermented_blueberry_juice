Noma's Lacto-Fermented Blueberry Juice
Origin and Philosophy Developed at Noma, the two-Michelin-starred restaurant in Copenhagen, this recipe represents the cornerstone of the New Nordic fermentation movement.1 The objective is not to preserve the blueberry as it is, but to transmute its natural sugars into lactic acid. This results in a liquid that retains the aromatic essence of the berry—its "blue" flavor—but sheds its cloying sweetness in favor of a sharp, vinous acidity and deep savory notes. This transformation allows the juice to be paired with rich meats or fatty dishes where a raw fruit juice would be cloying.4
The Science of the Salt Ratio The critical variable in this recipe is the salt concentration. A ratio of 2% salt by total weight of the fruit is the industry standard established by Noma’s fermentation lab.5 This specific salinity serves a dual purpose:
Pathogen Inhibition: It creates an environment hostile to harmful bacteria and molds, which generally cannot tolerate saline conditions.
Selection of Lab: It creates a favorable environment for halotolerant (salt-tolerant) lactic acid bacteria (LAB) naturally present on the fruit skins. These bacteria consume glucose and fructose, producing lactic acid and carbon dioxide.1
Recipe Architecture
The master recipe relies on wild blueberries, which possess a higher skin-to-flesh ratio than cultivated varieties, providing more tannins and a deeper anthocyanin content.

Technical Execution The process begins with rinsing the berries to remove debris without scrubbing away the natural microbiome residing on the skins.6 The berries are tossed with the salt, which immediately begins to draw moisture from the fruit through osmosis, creating a brine. Noma utilizes a vacuum-sealing technique, placing the salted berries in a bag and sealing it on maximum suction. This removal of oxygen is crucial as it strictly enforces anaerobic fermentation, preventing the growth of aerobic spoilage organisms like Kahm yeast.6
The sealed bag is kept at a warm ambient temperature, typically around 28°C (82°F), for 4 to 5 days. During this period, the bag will inflate due to CO2 production—a sign of active fermentation. The process is complete when the berries have softened significantly and the flavor profile has shifted from sweet to tart and savory. The juice is then harvested by straining, while the leftover berry solids can be dehydrated for use as a seasoning powder.4
Sensory Profile and Usage The resulting liquid is intensely concentrated, possessing a "body and effervescence" alongside saltiness, sweetness, and acidity.4 It is often mixed with spicy olive oil and floral spices (such as pink peppercorns) to dress tomatoes, or served in small quantities as a beverage pairing.
