Hawaiian POG
9.1 The Golden Ratio and History
POG (Passion fruit, Orange, Guava) was created in 1971 by Mary Soon, a consultant for Haleakala Dairy in Maui, to use up excess fruit. It has since become an icon. While commercially available in cartons, the homemade version using high-quality nectars is superior. The "master" insight here is the ratio. While many assume equal parts, the acidity of the passion fruit (lilikoi) often overpowers the others. A master recipe adjusts for this to create a harmonious blend.38
9.2 Sourcing the Nectars
Passion Fruit: Frozen pulp (Goya or similar) or high-quality concentrate is preferred. "Juice cocktail" is mostly sugar water.
Guava: Pink guava nectar provides the classic color and floral scent.
Orange: Freshly squeezed Valencia orange juice provides the body.
9.3 The Master Recipe: The 1:1:1 (With Adjustments)
Ingredients:
Passion Fruit Juice/Nectar: 1 cup.
Guava Nectar: 1 cup.
Orange Juice: 1 cup (pulp-free).
Simple Syrup: Optional, depending on the sweetness of the nectars used.
Preparation Protocol:
Blending: Simply combine the three chilled juices in a pitcher.
The "Hard" Shake: Unlike other juices, POG benefits from aeration. Shaking it vigorously (or blending briefly) creates a frothy head that mimics the texture of fresh juice.40
Service: Serve over ice. It is a simple recipe, but the quality of the specific nectars dictates the success.
