Agua de Pepino y Limón
13.1 The Whole Vegetable Approach
Like the Melon Agua Fresca, the best Cucumber Lime waters utilize the entire vegetable—seeds and all. The blending and straining process extracts the essence of the cucumber without the fibrous pulp.52
13.2 Balancing Bitterness
Cucumbers can be bitter due to cucurbitacins, concentrated in the ends and skin. The "master" tip is to taste the cucumber ends before blending. If bitter, peel them. If sweet, leave the skin on for a vibrant green color.53
13.3 The Master Recipe: The Green Refresher
Ingredients:
Cucumbers: 2 large (English preferred). Roughly chopped.
Limes: Juice of 4-5 limes (approx. ½ cup).
Water: 6 cups.
Sugar: ½ cup (Agua frescas are meant to be sweet).
Mint: A handful of fresh leaves (optional).
Preparation Protocol:
Blending: Blend the chopped cucumbers with the lime juice, sugar, and 2 cups of water until fully liquified. Add mint here if using.52
Straining: Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a pitcher. Press the solids to get all the juice.
Dilution: Add the remaining water. Taste. It should be slightly stronger than you want, as ice will dilute it.53
Service: Serve over ice with cucumber wheels.
