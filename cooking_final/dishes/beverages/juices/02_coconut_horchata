Rick Bayless’s Coconut Horchata
Origin and Philosophy Horchata in Mexico is rice-based. The challenge is extracting flavor from hard, raw rice. Rick Bayless’s "Master" technique involves a dual-process: soaking the rice with cinnamon to soften it, then blending it so finely that it becomes a "milk".36
Recipe Architecture
Base: Long-grain white rice, Mexican cinnamon stick (canela).
Soak: Water, overnight.
Enrichment: Coconut milk, sugar.
Technical Execution The raw rice and cinnamon stick are soaked in water overnight. The cinnamon softens enough to be blended with the rice. This mixture is blended on high speed until absolutely smooth (no grit), then strained. This "rice milk" is then enriched with coconut milk and sugar. The coconut fat emulsifies with the rice starch, creating a drink with the viscosity of heavy cream but a clean, plant-based finish.
