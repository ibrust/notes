The Clarified Milk Punch (Green Tea & Tropical)
Origin: Technique-Driven (General High-End)
Profile: Silky, Crystal Clear, Complex, Softly Sweet.
Milk clarification is the ultimate technique for the master mixologist. It uses the interaction between acid and protein to strip out tannins and solids, leaving behind whey protein. This whey gives the drink a lush, oily mouthfeel that is impossible to achieve with sugar alone.
The Architecture:
This is a batch process. The "punch" base is a mix of strong green tea (tannins), pineapple juice (acid/enzyme), and spices.
