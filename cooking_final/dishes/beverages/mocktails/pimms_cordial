The "Pimm's" Crown (Homemade Cordial)
Origin: Rob Brouse / Good Drinks
Profile: Bitter, Spiced, Fruity, Herbal.
This recipe rejects the pre-made "fruit cup" sodas in favor of a homemade maceration that extracts the medicinal complexity of roots and barks.
The Architecture:
The Cordial: A reduction of orange/lemon/lime peels, Rooibos tea (earthy), Assam tea (tannic), juniper berries, and Gentian Root.
Gentian Root: This is the key. It is the primary bittering agent in Angostura and many amaros. Including it gives the cordial a persistent, back-of-tongue bitterness.

The Master Preparation:
Simmer the peels, teas, and botanicals in sugar and water for 10 minutes. Add a splash of raspberry vinegar (for shrub-like acidity) and let steep for an hour. Strain.
Build in a tall glass with ice and ginger ale. The tannins from the black tea and the bitterness from the gentian create a "grip" that feels distinctly adult.
