The Salted Rosemary Paloma
Origin: Julia Bainbridge / Naren Young
Profile: Savory, Tart, Saline, Mediterranean.
Salt is a flavor potentiator. It suppresses bitterness and enhances sweetness and aroma. In this Paloma, a high-salinity syrup is used to tame the bitterness of the grapefruit pith, allowing the floral qualities of the fruit to shine.
The Architecture:
Salted Rosemary Syrup: A 1:1 simple syrup infused with fresh rosemary and a high concentration of Maldon sea salt (1 tsp per cup).

The Master Preparation:
Build directly in a Collins glass. Add syrup and juices, then fill with ice. Top with soda and lift gently with a barspoon to mix. The saltiness makes the drink incredibly sessionable and savory, pulling it away from the "soda" category and into the "cocktail" category.
