The Coffee Cold Brew (The Caffeine Concentrate)
The Thesis: High TDS (Total Dissolved Solids) liquid allows for flavor intensity without dilution.
The Science: Hot coffee melts ice cream. Weak iced coffee dilutes it. The solution is Cold Brew Concentrate, which creates a high concentration of coffee solubles (1:4 ratio) with low acidity. Alternatively, Instant Espresso Powder dissolves directly into the water phase of the milk without adding volume.33
The Master Protocol:
The Concentrate: Use 2 oz of undiluted Cold Brew Concentrate.
The Base: Coffee Ice Cream (to layer flavor) or Vanilla (for a Latte profile).
The Liquid: Reduce milk to 0.25 cups to account for the liquid coffee.
Texture: Add a teaspoon of ultra-fine cocoa powder to add "dryness" to the finish, mimicking a cappuccino.34
Why it is a Candidate: It is the functional shake—delivering caffeine and sugar in a balanced suspension.
