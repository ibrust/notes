The "Custard Density" Vanilla (Shake Shack Copycat)
The Thesis: The ultimate vanilla shake relies on egg-yolk lecithin for emulsion stability, not just cream.
The Science: Most home milkshakes are made with "Philadelphia-style" ice cream (cream, milk, sugar, no eggs). However, the gold standard for density—exemplified by the Shake Shack protocol—utilizes frozen custard. Custard must contain at least 1.4% egg yolk solids by weight.7 Egg yolks contain lecithin, a phospholipid that acts as a powerful emulsifier, binding water and fat molecules more tightly than milk proteins alone. This results in a "dense" texture that feels heavier on the tongue and melts slower than standard ice cream.8
The Master Protocol:
To replicate this at home without industrial custard machines, the recipe demands a specific sourcing of ingredients.
The Base: One pint of "French Vanilla" or "Frozen Custard" ice cream. Look for "egg yolks" in the top five ingredients.
The Solvent: 0.5 cups of whole milk. Skim milk is strictly prohibited as the water content encourages crystal growth.
The Technique: The mixture is blended on the lowest possible setting. The goal is merely to combine, not to aerate.
The Refinement: For the true "Master" version, one adds a teaspoon of instant vanilla pudding mix (modified cornstarch) to the blender. This mimics the mouthfeel of industrial stabilizers used in high-end fast food, preventing separation.9
Why it is a Candidate: It sets the benchmark for "mouthfeel." If the Master Recipe is about texture, this is the winner.
