CHICKEN NOODLE SOUP - DONE
===================================================

The preparation of this soup is divided into 4 phases:
    1) stock creation 
    2) sweating and simmering the aromatic vegetables
    3) poaching the chicken breast and sauteing the spaetzle w/ butter & nutmeg 
    4) finishing with herbs & lemon 


Phase 1 - stock creation: 

    we will cook the stock in a pressure cooker. 
        inside a pressure cooker, at 11-15 psi (depending on the model), chemical reactions are accelerated. 
            the rate at which connective tissues breakdown into gelatin is accelerated.
            it also allows for a more rapid maillard reaction which mimics slow roasting (especially at 15 psi). 
            
            the boiling point of water also increases from 212F to ~240F-250F. 

        Traditionally soups start with cold water that's brought to a boil. 
            During this time, scum rises to the surface (coagulated blood, and a protein found in muscle tissue called myoglobin),
            where it can be skimmed off. 
            These proteins have a dull flavor that muddies the soup. 
            In a pressure cooker, since it is sealed, you cannot skim the soup.

            We'll use a blanching technique to remove the scum before adding it to the pressure cooker. 
                In a separate pot we'll bring the carcass to a boil for 1 minute, and pour out that water. 
                Then we'll rinse off the bones in cold water.
    
        A pressure cooker tends to take a while to ramp up. 
            During this time flavors degrade but there's not alot of collagen extraction happening.
            So we will boil the water before adding it to the pot. 

        the main failure point in pressure cooker stocks is it being watery. 
            this is often due to adding too much water. 
            because the pressure cooker is sealed, evaporation is negligible (less than 5%).         
            it is critical to use only the minimum amount of water. 
                fill the water line up to only barely cover the solids.
                we target a 2:3 ratio of solids:water. 
                the recipe's recommended 2-3 quarts of water is merely an estimate. 

            also be sure not to go past the max line.
        
        For 11 psi pressure cooking, test kitchen results suggest that a chicken stock should cook between 60-75 minutes. 

        When cooking completes we do not immediately open the valve to release the pressure. 
            That causes the internal pressure to drop instantly, which forces the superheated liquid to boil violently throughout the pot. 
            This turbulence churns the fat and calcium phosphate particles into a stable emulsion, resulting in a milky, opaque stock. 
            
            Furthermore, when you release immediately, you are not just removing "soup" (water + flavor) in equal ratios. 
                You are actively stripping volatile compounds at a rate far higher than the water loss.
                Many of the aromatic compounds have a much higher vapor pressure than water.
                The steam preferentially grabs these highly volatile molecules and ejects them into the air.
        
            So one solution is to cut off the heat and let the pressure cooker sit for 40 minutes (for instant pot pro).
                This allows the temp reaches 212-215F (negligible release), and the water doesn't boil violently. 

                However, we don't want to wait too long, since volatile flavor compounds continue to degrade under heat.
                    The instant pot pro is insulated and can take longer to cool down. 

                But the Instant Pot Pro features a QuickCool tray. 
                    This is a removable cover on the lid where ice can be placed to accelerate condensation and pressure drop.
                    User reports and tests indicate this can reduce the depressurization time from 40 minutes to ~10–12 minutes (we'll see).
                    But the goal is to wait until the float valve drops or the temperature sensor reads 212-215F

    we'll also be using wings, in addition to a whole carcass. 
        wings have a high amount of skin and cartilage, which contains glycine and proline, the amino acids responsible for gelatin formation. 

    before putting the yellow onion into the stock, we will cut it in half and char it in a pan.
        first the onion's sugars to undergo rapid caramelization, 
            followed by pyrolysis (carbonization) which creates a black layer of carbon and complex polymers. 
        when simmered, this char dissolves into the stock, adding a calibrated bitterness to it. 
            chicken fat is naturally rich and sweet. The slight acridity of the charred onion balances that out. 

        in classical french stock making the term for this is oignon brûlée (burnt onion)

        the onion is charred on the cut side only. the rest remains raw before entering the pot. 
            if the entire onion was charred, it'd become mush and may dissolve in the pressure cooker, clouding the stock. 

        leaving the skin on the onion adds further color and flavor complexity. 

    The spices - allspice, black peppercorn, bay leaves, garlic - must be managed carefully to avoid overpowering the chicken. 
        Allspice contains euganol. It provides a warming sensation. 
            We will add 5 of them (more could make the stock taste like holiday spice) 

    The dark top of leeks are rich in chlorophyll and sulfur compounds. 
        Using them in stock provides a deeper vegetable flavor than onion by itself. 

    We don't use carrots in the stock. 
        apparently in a pressure cooker they can break down too much and make the stock taste like a vegetable stew. 
        This is especially a concern with carrots due to their sweetness, but celery can also run into some issues. 


Phase 2 - sweating and simmering the aromatic vegetables:

    the combination of carrots, celeriac, parsley root, parsley, and leeks is a traditional Polish one called Włoszczyzna.
    It's also worth noting that almost all the vegetables used in this phase belong to the Apiaceae family (Umbelliferae). 
        This ensures a harmonious chemical profile. The flavors stack vertically instead of competing. 
    
    We'll sweat the vegetables to soften them & release moisture, but we won't brown them. 
        If they were browned, they'd take on a heavy, stew-like roasted flavor that would obscure the delicate parsley root and fennel. 
        Cook them on low heat with butter and salt. 
            Salt helps draw water out of the vegetables.

    Parsley root tastes like a blend of celeriac, carrot, and parsley. 
        If parsley root is unavailable you can substitute in parsnips. 
            But be aware that parsnips are sweeter. 
            To counteract this, add a bit more lemon juice than you usually would.
            Also add in extra parsley during the sweat to get additional herbal flavor you may otherwise lack. 

    Celeriac is dense and starchy. 
        If celeriac is unavailable you can substitute in celery and yukon gold potato. 
            The potato provides the starchiness, while the celery provides the flavor profile. 

    Parmsesan rind boosts the amount of free glutamates. 
        Parmesan cheese is one of the most glutamate-rich foods. It's essentially a natural, whole food form of MSG. 
        The glutamates chemically work synergistically with chicken specifically to enhance umami. 


Phase 3 - poaching the chicken breast and sauteing the spaetzle w/ butter & nutmeg: 

    Chicken breast consists primarily of fast-twitch muscle fibers which contain very little connective tissue or fat. 
        At temperatures above 150F the muscle fibers contract, squeezing out intracellular water. 
        If boiled in the soup the breast will become dry and stringy within minutes. 

        So we'll poach the chicken delicately, by bringing the soup to a simmer and then turning off the heat before adding the breast. 
            The temperature of the liquid will slowly drop from ~200F to ~160F, while the chicken rises to ~150F for 3 minutes. 
            This gentle gradient prevents the violent conttraction of muscle fibers. 
            But be sure to monitor the temperature of the pot carefully, and turn back on the heat tolow if it drops down too far.
            I think using a dutch oven here may also be helpful, since it will retain heat. 

    boiling the dired spaetzle hydrates the starch granules, causing them to swell and burst (genatinization). 
        This makes the noodle edible. 

        Most home cooks dump boiled spaetzle directly into the soup. 
            This is a mistake.
            The surface of boiled spaetzle is sticky and porous. It will absorb soup liquid, become soggy, and disintegrate. 

        Instead we'll transfer the boiled spaetzle to a skillet with butter and nutmeg. 
            This will drive off the surface water from the spaetzle. 
            The amino acids in the egg dough will also react with sugars in the butter to create a brown, crispy skin. 

            The result will be that a hydrophobic barrier forms around the spaetzle, which will allow it to stand up to the broth later. 

        Nutmeg is highly lipophilic (oil-loving). Its flavor compounds (myristicin, elemicin) dissolve best in fat. 
            By grating the nutmeg and combining with the butter in the saute, its flavor compounds will be captured and coat the noodles. 
            Nutmeg + fat + starch is a classic german flavor pairing. 


Phase 4 - finishing with herbs & lemon: 

    In this phase we add delicate volatile compounds that are destroyed by heat or time. 

    Marjoram is a sweeter, milder cousin to oregano. 
        It contains volatile terpenes that are easily sublimated. 

    Dried marjoram can taste dusty or gritty if not properly hydrated, but lose flavor if boiled too long. 
        Part of the solution is to vigorously rub the dried herb between your palms before adding it. 
            This friction generates localized heat and p hysically fractures the dried leaf structure, releasing dormant oils. 

        But the herb still needs time to rehydrate. 
            So we will add it to the spaetzle saute. The hot butter will instantly bloom the dried herb. 
                Rehydrating it with fat rather potentiates the flavor more effectively than simmering in broth. 

    A rich chicken stock with butter has a high fat content. To perceive the flavors clearly, acid is required to cut the fat. 
        A ratio of 1 tbsp lemon juice per quart of soup is the max before the soup starts to taste sour. 

        Lemon juice should never be boiled. It is added at the very end to preserve the fresh limonene aromatics. 

    Pink peppercorns are not true peppers. They are dried berries of the peruvian pepper tree. 
        They have a piney, citrusy sweetness with very little heat. 
        They must be crushed in a mortar to release their aroma. If used whole, they can be unpleasantly large.

===================================================
PREPARATION 
===================================================

1) prepare the stock ingredients 

    a) prepare the 1 large leek 
        i) trim the root end off
        ii) cut off the dark tops & save them for the stock 
        iii) if the outer leaf seems tough & fibrous you can pull it off
        iv) cut the leek into sections about 4 inches long, and cut them in half lengthwise 
        v) put the sections in a bowl of water. separate the layers to allow grit to leave. work the grit out. 

    b) smash the 4 garlic cloves. 
        you don't need to peel the skins off, they'll add flavor to the stock 
    
    c) char the onion 
        i) cut the onion in half 
        ii) heat a dry skillet over high heat 
        iii) place the onion halves cut-side down into the pan
            press firmly
            sear for 4-6 minutes until the face is blackened 

    d) prepare the chicken 
        i) remove the legs. cut a slit between the thigh and the breast 
        ii) pull the legs back and pop the leg joints out
        iii) cut through the tendons that were connecting that joint and remove the legs 
        iv) cut off the skin around the breast (it goes in the stock). use the knife to trim the skin away 
        v) remove the breasts. 
            make a downward indecision right next to the center bone, following the bone downward (scraping it). 
            continue following the bone, the breast will reach the point where it can easily come off with a little cutting around the wing
        vi) separate the tenderloins from the breasts 
        vii) trim any fat off the tenderloisn / breasts and put that in the stock as well. 
            put the tenderloisn / breasts in the refridgerator

2) blanch the chicken
    a) put the carcass and wings in a pot filled with water, and bring it to a boil for 1 minute
    b) drain and pour out the water 
    c) rinse off the carcass to ensure any remaining coagulated proteins are removed

3) pressure cook the stock 
    a) bring the filtered water for the stock to a boil (2-3 quarts)
    b) in the pressure cook pot tightly pack the chicken legs, thighs, carcass, and wings 
    c) wedge into the gaps the ingredients: 
        - the charred onion
        - leek greens
        - 4 garlic cloves smashed 
        - 2 bay leaves
        - 1 tsp peppercorns
        - 5 allspice berries
    d) pour in the water. 
        stop pouring the moment the water level matches the top of the chicken
        you want about a 2:3 ratio of solids:water
    e) seal the lid. listen for the chime to indicate closure 
    f) configure the pressure cooker 
        i) press the button labeled "pressure cook". 
            The display will illuminate. The "Custom" preset is usually the default. If not, the segment for presets will flash. 
        ii) The Pressure Level segment (low/high) on the LCD screen will be flashing. 
            If "high" is not selected, rotate the control dial until "high" is selected. 
            Press the center of the control dial to confirm. 
        iii) The time segment (0:00) will be flashing. 
            Rotate the control dial clockwise to select 65 minutes 
            Press the center of the control dial to confirm. 
        iv) The focus may move to "Vent Reminder". Set to Off if prompted 
        v) Press the start button. This display will show "On" and the preheating progress bar will begin to load 
    g) when cooking is completed (the unit will beep), begin the release
        i) for the instant pot pro, put ice onto the quick cooling tray 
        ii) it may take anywhere between 10-25 minutes to cool sufficiently, you'll have to see
        iii) when the float valve drops, or when the temperature reads 212-215F, it's done
    h) strain the stock through a fine mesh sieve.
        keep the wing / leg meat and discard the remaining solids.
    i) skim the fat from the surface as the liquid cools


3) prepare the soup vegetables (do this once the release phase begins)

    a) ~1/2 inch dice the fennel bulb 
        i) cut off the fronts (tops) & save them 
        ii) cut off the base 
        iii) take a peeler and peel off some of the outer layer (unless the outer layer looks bad, then you can peel off the whole layer) 

    b) slice the leek whites into half-moons 

    c) ~1/2 inch dice the 3 large carrots 
        i) peel the carrots
        ii) cut off the tip & the root 
        iii) cut them lengthwise into 1/2 inch wide strips, then dice them 

    d) ~1/2 inch dice the celeriac. if unavailable dice 3 celery ribs + 1 yukon gold potato
        i) slice off the top & bottom of the celeriac 
        ii) use a knife to cut off the skin around the outside, similar to peeling a jicama 
        iii) rinse off the celeriac, it can be dirty still 
        iv) dice into 1/2 inch cubes

    e) ~1/2 inch dice the 3 parsley roots. if unavailable dice 2 parsnips + 2 tbsp chopped parsley stems
        prepare these the same way you do a carrot 


4) sweat the soup vegetables 
    a) in a dutch oven (which you'll cook the soup in) melt 2 tbsp unsalted butter over low heat 
    b) add the following: 
        - leek whites
        - fennel
        - pinch of salt
    c) cover / sweat for 8-10 minutes until soft / transcluent. do not brown
    d) add carrots / celeriac / parsley root
    e) increase heat to medium & saute for 3 minutes to coat in fat 
    f) pour the strained stock over the vegetables
    g) add the parmesan rind and 4 thyme sprigs
    h) simmer uncovered at 185-205F for 20 minutes until roots are tender (but remember, the chicken boil will also cook these)
    g) remove parmesan rind and thyme 


5) poach the chicken breasts
    a) bring the soup up to 200F and turn off the heat 
    b) submerge the raw chicken breasts and cover the pot 
    c) let stand for 15-20 minutes
    d) periodically check the chicken breast & ensure it's reached 150F internal temperature for 3 minutes
        also check that the soup is still hot enough (above 165F), and turn on low heat if it gets too cool
        this technique of turning off the heat is typically done with a larger pot, but if it's a dutch oven it should retain heat
    e) remove the chicken breast, shred it with a fork, then return it to the soup 

6) cook & saute the spaetzle 

    a) boil the 10oz of spaetzle in salted water
        for bechtle's brand it'll cook 21 minutes in 1 quart per 4 oz, so 2.5 quarts
    b) chop some fresh parsley 
    c) prepare an ice bath 
    d) a few minutes before the spaetzle is ready, heat a skillet with 2 tbsp salted butter 
    e) cook the pasta 1 minute less than the package says
    f) drain the pasta & immediately transfer it to an ice bath to stop the cooking, then to a skillet immediately afterwards 
    g) rub the 1 tbs dried marjoram between palms over the pan
    h) grate or add the nutmeg (~1/2 tsp) to the saute 
    i) suate for 4-5 minutes
    j) toss with half of the chopped fresh parsley 

7) finish the soup 

    a) place a mound of pasta in the bowl 
    b) add the soup to the bowl 
    c) squeeze 1 tsp lemon juice over the bowl 
    d) top with crushed pink peppercorns & fennel fronds

SERVING
===================================================

===================================================
MEAL COMBINATIONS
===================================================

1) Cornichnos or Gherkins pickles - baby cucumbers, ideally from Hengstenberg or Kühne brands (again check the international isle)

2) Pepperidge Farm Frozen Apple Turnovers or Strudels

3) Whole Rye, Pumpernickel, or Fitness Bread - found in the international aisle of most major supermarkets (check the international isle)
    German whole grain bread is fundamentally different from American rye. 
        It is baked at low temperatures for long periods (up to 20 hours for pumpernickel), stimulating a profound Maillard reaction.

4) smoked trout &/or Cambozola cheese (Black Label variety - aged longer)
    goes well with the bread
