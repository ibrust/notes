POTATO LEEK SOUP
===================================================


In the early 20th century, Louis Diat introduced Vichyssoise, his refinement of the traditionally rustic, hot potato-leek soup. 
    Vichyssoise was a chilled version, which added heavy cream and was pureed until ultra-smooth.
    Our recipe will remain hot, but borrow some of Vichyssoise's refinements. 


The selection of the potatoes is of high importance. 
    Potatoes are classified by their ratio of amylose to amylopectin.
    This ratio determines behavior when heated or mechnically agitated. 

        Variant             Starch Percentage           Impact on Soup Viscosity                Recommended Use

        Russet / Idaho      20-22% (high starch)        rapidly disintegrates,                  best when riced for light fluffiness
                                                        risk of glueyness if over processed

        yukon gold          18% (medium)                buttery flavor,                         this recipe's preferred choice
                                                        balances creaminess & stability

        red bliss/new waxy  16% (low)                   holds shape.                            best for rustic, chunky soups
                                                        yields a thinner, less cremay broth.
                                                        low risk of gumminess

        ratte / fingerling  17% (low/medium)            deep nutty flavor                       ideal for ultra-smooth purees

    for a home chef, yukon gold is an optimal middle ground between ease of use and superior flavor. 
        its medium starch content provides sufficient thickening power without the extreme fragility of the russet,
        which can turn gluey in a matter of seconds if subjected to the high-shear force of a blender. 


The selection of alliums is also critical. 
    While a basic recipe would only use leeks, we'll use a complex base of leeks, yellow onion, and shallot to maximize depth.
    
        leeks               delicate, grassy, sweet         primary flavor 
        yellow onions       robust, savory                  builds the foundational backbone
        shallots            sharp, refined, acidic          adds elegant top-notes and subtle complexity

    we'll trim away the dark-green tops and only use the whtie and pale green stalks. 


Julia Child's original recipe used plain water to allow the pure flavor of the vegetables to shine. 
    However, modern culinary consensus favors high-quality, homemade chicken stock. 
    The gelatin content provides body that water can't replicate, and the amino acids (glutamates) enhnace umami. 

The first stage of cooking, where the aromatic vegetables interact with fats, is critical for flavor.
    
    Sweating occurs at ~285F. 
        At this temperature, the moisture in the leek cells / onions will expand, 
        causing the cells to rupture and release their sugars / aromatic compounds, 
        but without inducing the Maillard reaction (browning).
            browning (caramelized sugars) would introduce a heavy sweetness that competes with the delicate leeks. 

    Sauteing begins at ~350F. 
        In the context of leeks, this temperature risks scorching them.
        Scorched leeks release bitter compounds that can't be masked later. 
        
    To prevent heating past 285F it'll be important to use a pot that doesn't have hotspots. 


The biggest challenge is to prevent the soup from becoming gluey. 
    As potatoes cook in liquid, their starch granules absorb water and swell (a process known as gelatinization). 
    In yukon gold and russet potatoes, these granulates are particularly fragile once they reach 160F. 
    
    If these swollen granules are subjected to high-shear force (i.e. a blender) they'll rupture. 
        This released a flood of amylose inot the soup, which forms a sticky, elastic network. 

    So to achieve optimal texture we'll use a potato ricer, which mashes them with a low amount of shear. 
        The potato ricer will separate the potato cells without shredding them. 

        Many chefs will fish their potatoes out of the broth after cooking a bit, rice them, then whick them back in. 
            This ensures a velvety texture that isn't gummy. 

Seasoning potato-based soups is notoriously difficult due to the starch/sodium interaction. 
    Salt should be added in layers. 
    Adding all the salt at the beginning can lead to over-concentration as the liquid reduces. 
    Adding it all at the end will mean it doesn't integrate into the vegetables. 

    Typically you want 1 to 1.5 tsp of salt per quart of liquid.

White pepper is made by ferminting the berries to remove the outer husk. 
    This creates a floral heat that pairs well with the potato / alliums. 
    Black pepper is sharper and can clash with the delicate alliums. 

The skins of yukon gold potatoes contain high concentrations of potato flavor and minerals. 
    One optional technique involves taking clean peelings, placing them in a muslin bag, and simmering them in the soup. 
    This allows for maximum flavor extraction without compromising the smoothness of the final puree. 

Adding white miso paste during the final dairy enrichment phase provides a fermented depth and savoriness
    that mimics the complexity of long-aged cheese. 

It's good to render a few strips of bacon in the pot before adding the butter. 
    The leeks are then sweated ina  combination of bacon fat and butter. 
    The smokiness pairs naturally with the earthy potatoes.


For potato-leek soup, mirepoix blanc (white onion, parsnip, celeriac, leek tops) is the superior chicken stock.
    - celeriac has a more concentrated, earthy flavor than celery. It provides phthalides that enhance the savoriness of chicken. 
        celeriac releases its sugars slower, and stands up to long cook times better than celery, which can turn bitter. 
    - white onion provides sulfur compounds and sweetness. It's also chosen for color
    - parsnips have a complex, woody sweetness that balance the earthiness of the celeriac. 
        parsnips flavor is more complex than carrots, and they also wind up sweeter in long-cooked stocks. 
        parsnips also go well with nutmeg
        carrots can also instill a vegetable soup flavor that overwhelms the delicate leeks.
    - leek tops are the most flavorful, sulfur-rich part of the leek. 
        They're discarded from soups because they're too tough and fibrous, but that's an asset in long extraction.
        Using them here adds layers of leek flavor. 
    
    mirepoix blanc will also include umami boosters: mushroom stems, white peppercorns, cloves, and bouquet garni
        since the soup is low in protein, these provide a needed umami boost. 

        - Mushroom stems are high in guanylate and glutamate, which synergize with chicken to enhance the meatiness flavor.
        - White peppercorns provide clean, sharp heat. 
        - Cloves provide a subtle aromatic lift. 
        - The bouquet garni contains thyme and bay leaves, standard herbal pairings for both chicken and leeks. 

In the stock of a chicken noodle soup, the goal is a clean, savory liquid that tastes like poultry. 
    Extraction of the primary flavor compounds from muscle meat and aromatics happens often within ~60-75 minutes at 12 PSI.

    For a potato-leek soup, the stock acts as a structural ingredient. 
        You need maximum gelatin to coat the potato starch granules, preventing the soup from becoming gluey. 
        To fully hydrolyze the collagen of the wings / carcass into gelatin at 12 PSI, you need ~120 minutes.

A brown stock relies on the maillard reaction and caramelization achieved through roasting. 
A white stock focuses on the pure extraction of collagen and aromatic compounds without introducing roasted flavors. 

Professional sauciers often prefer 12 PSI for a white stock because it's less aggressive. 
    There's a reduced risk of over-extraction, where the bones begin to release minerals that can impart a chalky / bitter flavor. 

Potatoes release alot of starch during cooking and blending. 
The stock will be highly concentrated with type II collagen and volatile aromatic compounds. 
    In a potato-leek soup, the interaction between stock and starch is a defining characteristic. 
    
    When potatoes are simmered in the stock, the gelatin will act as a hydrocolloid. 
        As the starch granulates hydrate and swell, the gellatin provides a protective matrix, 
        preventing them from bursting and releasing too much amylopectin into the liquid.
        This is especially important if the soup is to be blended. 
            A water-based potato soup often becomes gummy when blended. 
            A gelatin-rich stock will allow it to maintain a silky, creamy texture without the need for excessive dairy.

Cooking mirepoix blanc under pressure at high temperature creates a different flavor profile than atmospheric simmering.
    Under pressure, the sulfur compounds in the leek tops and onion are forced back into the liquid rather than escaping as steam.
    This results in a stock that has a stronger allium flavor.
        Fortunately this matches the flavor profile of a leek soup.
    The celeriac / parsnip will provide an earthy / sweet base that rounds out the alliums, and creates a long finish on the palate.

===================================================
STOCK PREPARATION 
===================================================


1) blanch the chicken 
    a) place the whole chicken / the wings in a large pot and cover with cold tap water.
    b) bring the water to a rolling boil
    c) maintain the boil for 3-5 minutes
    d) drain the pot & discard the blanched water 
    e) rinse the chicken under cold running water
    f) use hands or a brush to remove any coagulated scum from the chicken cavity and joints 

2) prepare the vegetables 
    a) cut up and de-grit the leeks
        set aside 4 oz of leek tops for the stock 
        discard the rest of the leek tops
        save the leek whites / pale greens
    b) cut away the skin of the celeriac
        set aside 4 oz of the celeriac, cut into 1/4 inch cubes
        discard the rest 
    c) peel the parsnip
        cut the parsnip into 1-inch rounds
        set aside 4 oz
    d) quarter the onion
        set aside 4 oz
        discard the rest
    e) wash the mushrooms in cold water 
        destem 15-20
        leave them whole or halved
        set aside 3 oz 
        save the caps to saute as a side dish 

3) pressure cook 
    a) put the vegetables into the pot 
    b) add the bouquet garni (2 bay leaves, 4 thyme sprigs)
    c) add the 1 tsp white peppercorns
    d) add the 2 whole cloves 
    e) add the chicken to the pot 
    f) fill with water until the ingredients are covered, not exceeding the max fill line 
        you may as well at least warm the water before you put it in, so that it doesn't take as long to reach pressure
    g) pressure cook for 120 minutes 
    h) do an ice-accelerated natural release

4) strain the stock
    a) remove the large solids from the pot 
    b) strain out the remaining solids & discard

5) cool the stock (if saving for later)
    a) rapidly cool the stock in an ice bath 
    b) place the stock in the fridge or freezer depending on when you plan on using it
    c) after its cooled you can skim some or all of the chicken fat off


===================================================
SOUP PREPARATION 
===================================================

1) prepare for ingredients
    a) thinly slice the leeks (750g)
    b) dice the yellow onion (100g)
    c) thinly slice the shallots (1/2 cup)
    d) mince the 3 cloves garlic (~1 tbsp)
    e) create a cartouche
    f) cube the potatoes, 1/2 inch, ~3.3 lbs (after peeling)
    g) create a bouquet garni of the bay leaves / thyme / parsley 

2) render the bacon fat 
    a) fry 5 strips of bacon in a triple-ply stainless steel soup pot  
    b) keep 2 tbsp of the bacon fat, discard the rest
    c) put the bacon in the fridge for garnish later

3) sweat the aromatics
    a) turn the heat on medium-low, the pot should be ~285F
    b) add to the pot:
        - 3 tbsp butter 
        - 1.5 tbsp olive oil (layering these fats ensures it doesn't taste all like bacon or butter)
    c) once the butter begins to foam, add the following: 
        - leeks 
        - onions 
        - shallots 
    d) stir to coat the vegetables in the fat 
    e) add 1/2 tsp salt (this facilitates osmosis)
    f) add the cartouche 
    g) sweat the vegetables for 15 minutes 
    h) add the minced garlic
    g) cook an additional 2 minutes, until the garlic is translucent. 
        If the garlic starts to develop color, add stock to lower the surface temperature.


4) add the potatoes 
    a) add the cubed yukon gold potatoes to the pot 
        stir them in and mix everything
    b) cook for 3-5 minutes. 
        coating the potatoes with fat helps protect their surface, preventing them from disintegrating in the broth later.

5) simmer
    a) pour 2.5 quarts of chicken stock into the pot
    b) bring the mixture to a boil
    c) reduce heat to low
    d) simmer between 185-205F (the potatoes will cook without being tossed too aggressively, keeping them intact)
    e) simmer partially covered for 30-40 minutes
        the potatoes must be soft enough that they crumble when pressed against the side of the pot with a spoon
    f) halfway through add 1 tsp salt

6) rice the potatoes 
    a) remove the bouquet garni 
    b) trasnfer the potatoes to a large bowl (soup them out) 
    c) blend the rest of the soup with an immersion blender until smooth 
    d) strain the soup through a fine-mesh seive to remove any remaining fibrous allium strands
    d) press the cooked potatoes through a potato ricer directly into the strained broth. 
        use the finest setting on the ricer (ensure every bit of potato is aerated with minimal shear). 
    e) use a hand whisk to mix riced potatoes with the broth. 

7) add the dairy
    a) in a small saucepan, warm 1/2 cup of heavy cream to 140F 
    b) cube 2 tbsp of butter
    c) take the soup pot off the heat, and wait until it's ~160F 
    d) whisk in the cubed butter 1 at a time
        160F is hot enough to melt the butter but low enough to maintain a stable emulsion
    e) whisk in the warmed cream
    f) whisk in the 1/2 cup buttermilk 
    g) add the 1.5 tbsp white miso

8) season to finish
    g) add the white pepper, 1 tsp
    h) add the nutmeg, 1/4 tsp
    i) add 1-2 tsp of salt to taste 
    j) stir in 1 tbsp fresh lemon juice 

===================================================
SERVING
===================================================

The ideal serving temperature is 160F.
    At this temperature, the aromatic compounds of hte leek are most active, and the butter is at its most palatable. 

If in season, a few shavings of black truffle or a drizzle of truffle oil (not synthetic) can elevate the flavors. 

You can also serve it with the bacon that was cooked earlier. 

THe soups the starches will continue to retrograde as the soup cools. 
    This often results in the soup becoming significantly thicker in the refrigerator
    When reheating, because the starch has tightened, the soup will require a splash of stock or milk to return to its consistency.

To prevent bacterial growth and maintain color, the soup should be cooled in an ice bath if possible.
Potato-based soups generally do not freeze well.
    The cell walls collapse and the emulsion separates during the freeze-thaw cycle, resulting in a grainy texture.
