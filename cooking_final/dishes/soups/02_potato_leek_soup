POTATO LEEK SOUP
===================================================


In the early 20th century, Louis Diat introduced Vichyssoise, his refinement of the traditionally rustic, hot potato-leek soup. 
    Vichyssoise was a chilled version, which added heavy cream and was pureed until ultra-smooth.
    Our recipe will remain hot, but borrow some of Vichyssoise's refinements. 


The selection of the potatoes is of high importance. 
    Potatoes are classified by their ratio of amylose to amylopectin.
    This ratio determines behavior when heated or mechnically agitated. 

        Variant             Starch Percentage           Impact on Soup Viscosity                Recommended Use

        Russet / Idaho      20-22% (high starch)        rapidly disintegrates,                  best when riced for light fluffiness
                                                        risk of glueyness if over processed

        yukon gold          18% (medium)                buttery flavor,                         this recipe's preferred choice
                                                        balances creaminess & stability

        red bliss/new waxy  16% (low)                   holds shape.                            best for rustic, chunky soups
                                                        yields a thinner, less cremay broth.
                                                        low risk of gumminess

        ratte / fingerling  17% (low/medium)            deep nutty flavor                       ideal for ultra-smooth purees

    for a home chef, yukon gold is an optimal middle ground between ease of use and superior flavor. 
        its medium starch content provides sufficient thickening power without the extreme fragility of the russet,
        which can turn gluey in a matter of seconds if subjected to the high-shear force of a blender. 


The selection of alliums is also critical. 
    While a basic recipe would only use leeks, we'll use a complex base of leeks, yellow onion, and shallot to maximize depth.
    
        leeks               delicate, grassy, sweet         primary flavor 
        yellow onions       robust, savory                  builds the foundational backbone
        shallots            sharp, refined, acidic          adds elegant top-notes and subtle complexity

    we'll trim away the dark-green tops and only use the whtie and pale green stalks. 


Julia Child's original recipe used plain water to allow the pure flavor of the vegetables to shine. 
    However, modern culinary consensus favors high-quality, homemade chicken stock. 
    The gelatin content provides body that water can't replicate, and the amino acids (glutamates) enhnace umami. 

The first stage of cooking, where the aromatic vegetables interact with fats, is critical for flavor.
    
    Sweating occurs at ~285F. 
        At this temperature, the moisture in the leek cells / onions will expand, 
        causing the cells to rupture and release their sugars / aromatic compounds, 
        but without inducing the Maillard reaction (browning).
            browning (caramelized sugars) would introduce a heavy sweetness that competes with the delicate leeks. 

    Sauteing begins at ~350F. 
        In the context of leeks, this temperature risks scorching them.
        Scorched leeks release bitter compounds that can't be masked later. 
        
    To prevent heating past 285F it'll be important to use a pot that doesn't have hotspots. 


The biggest challenge is to prevent the soup from becoming gluey. 
    As potatoes cook in liquid, their starch granules absorb water and swell (a process known as gelatinization). 
    In yukon gold and russet potatoes, these granulates are particularly fragile once they reach 160F. 
    
    If these swollen granules are subjected to high-shear force (i.e. a blender) they'll rupture. 
        This released a flood of amylose inot the soup, which forms a sticky, elastic network. 

    So to achieve optimal texture we'll use a potato ricer, which mashes them with a low amount of shear. 
        The potato ricer will separate the potato cells without shredding them. 

        Many chefs will fish their potatoes out of the broth after cooking a bit, rice them, then whick them back in. 
            This ensures a velvety texture that isn't gummy. 

Seasoning potato-based soups is notoriously difficult due to the starch/sodium interaction. 
    Salt should be added in layers. 
    Adding all the salt at the beginning can lead to over-concentration as the liquid reduces. 
    Adding it all at the end will mean it doesn't integrate into the vegetables. 

    Typically you want 1 to 1.5 tsp of salt per quart of liquid.

White pepper is made by ferminting the berries to remove the outer husk. 
    This creates a floral heat that pairs well with the potato / alliums. 
    Black pepper is sharper and can clash with the delicate alliums. 

The skins of yukon gold potatoes contain high concentrations of potato flavor and minerals. 
    One optional technique involves taking clean peelings, placing them in a muslin bag, and simmering them in the soup. 
    This allows for maximum flavor extraction without compromising the smoothness of the final puree. 

Adding white miso paste during the final dairy enrichment phase provides a fermented depth and savoriness
    that mimics the complexity of long-aged cheese. 

It's good to render a few strips of bacon in the pot before adding the butter. 
    The leeks are then sweated ina  combination of bacon fat and butter. 
    The smokiness pairs naturally with the earthy potatoes.


===================================================
MIREPOIX BLANC STOCK
===================================================

For potato-leek soup, mirepoix blanc (white onion, parsnip, celeriac, leek tops) is the superior chicken stock for a few reasons: 
    - celeriac / parsnip stand up to the long cooking times better than celery / carrot.
        they release their sugars and aromatics more slowly. they're also less prone to bitterness. 
    - parsnips go well with nutmeg
    - parsnips flavor is more complex than carrots, and also ends up sweeter than carrots in a long-cooked stock
    - carrots have a simple, distinct vegetable soup flavor that can overwhelm delicate leeks 
    - using the leek tops adds layers of leek flavor 
    - Mirepoix blanc often includes mushroom stems, which are high in glutamates. 
        since the soup is low in protein, these provided a needed umami flavor 

In the stock of a chicken noodle soup, the goal is a clean, savory liquid that tastes like poultry. 
    Extraction of the primary flavor compounds from muscle meat and aromatics happens often within ~60-75 minutes at 12 PSI.

    For a potato-leek soup, the stock acts as a structural ingredient. 
        You need maximum gelatin to coat the potato starch granules, preventing the soup from becoming gluey. 
        To fully hydrolyze the collagen of the wings / carcass into gelatin at 12 PSI, you need ~120 minutes.

STOCK PREPARATION 
===================================================

The production of a white chicken stock, or fond blanc, represents one of the most foundational and technically demanding exercises in the classical culinary arts, particularly when the end application is a refined potato-leek soup. Unlike a brown stock, which relies on the Maillard reaction and caramelization achieved through roasting, a white stock focuses on the pure extraction of collagen and aromatic essences without the introduction of dark pigments or roasted flavor compounds.1 In the context of a pressure-cooked environment reaching 12 PSI, the chef must navigate a specific set of thermodynamic and biochemical variables to ensure that the increased temperature does not emulsify lipids or degrade the delicate volatile compounds of the mirepoix blanc.4 This report provides an exhaustive examination of the ingredient selection and procedural algorithms required to produce a master-level stock tailored for the structural and flavor requirements of a starch-heavy, leek-centric soup.
Thermodynamic Dynamics of High-Pressure Extraction at 12 PSI
The use of a pressure vessel fundamentally alters the rate of collagen hydrolysis. At standard atmospheric pressure at sea level, water boils at  (), a temperature that requires six to eight hours of simmering to effectively convert the collagen in chicken bones into gelatin.1 A pressure cooker operating at 12 PSI (approximately 0.8 bar above atmospheric pressure) raises the boiling point of the liquid. The relationship between pressure and boiling point is described by the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, which predicts that at 12 PSI, the internal temperature reaches approximately  ().4
While many modern recipes are calibrated for 15 PSI ( / ), the 12 PSI environment is often preferred by professional sauciers for white stock because it is less aggressive.4 At , there is a heightened risk of "over-extraction," where the bones begin to release calcium and other minerals that can impart a chalky or bitter taste.10 The 12 PSI threshold allows for rapid gelatin extraction while maintaining a more nuanced aromatic profile. However, this lower temperature necessitates a temporal adjustment. Based on the logic of extraction kinetics, a recipe designed for 90 minutes at 15 PSI requires an increase of approximately 20% to 50% in duration to achieve the same molecular breakdown at 12 PSI.12

The absence of turbulent boiling inside the vessel is the primary mechanism for maintaining clarity.4 Because the pressure cooker is a sealed system, the liquid remains perfectly still despite the high temperature, provided the cooker does not vent steam aggressively. This stillness prevents the physical agitation that would otherwise emulsify fat into the water, a process that creates a milky, opaque appearance.4
Architectural Ingredient Determination for Potato-Leek Synergy
The selection of ingredients for this specific stock is governed by the chemical requirements of the potato-leek soup. Potatoes, particularly starchy varieties like Russets or buttery Yukons, release high levels of starch during the cooking and blending process. To balance this starch, the stock must possess a high gelatin content to provide a lubricating mouthfeel and preventing the "gluey" texture that occurs when starch granules over-link in a water-thin liquid.14
The Poultry Matrix: Whole Chicken and Wing Integration
The user’s selection of a whole chicken and a pound of wings is mathematically sound for a high-viscosity extraction. A whole chicken provides a complete spectrum of flavor: the breast meat offers clean, bright notes; the thighs and legs contribute deeper, savory intensity; and the carcass provides essential minerals.16 However, meat alone does not provide body. The addition of chicken wings is a strategic move to maximize collagen density. Wings are composed of multiple cartilage-rich joints and a high skin-to-meat ratio, making them the most efficient source of gelatin in the avian anatomy.11
The total weight of the poultry components (approx. 4.5–5 lbs) requires a specific volume of water to ensure a high concentration of dissolved solids. A ratio of 1:1 or 1.5:1 (water to poultry by weight) is recommended for a "master" strength stock.20 In a pressure cooker, where there is zero evaporation, adding too much water results in a diluted flavor that cannot be easily corrected without extensive reduction.7
The Mirepoix Blanc Components
The mirepoix blanc (white aromatics) is designed to provide flavor without the carotenoids found in carrots, which would turn the stock yellow or orange.2 This is critical for potato-leek soup, which is traditionally valued for its pale, creamy aesthetic.
Celeriac (Celery Root): Replacing the traditional Pascal celery stalks, celeriac offers a more concentrated, earthy flavor that is more stable under high pressure. It provides phthalides that enhance the savory quality of the chicken without the "stringy" bitterness of green stalks.23
White Onion: Specifically chosen over yellow or red onions to avoid pigment leaching from the skins. The onion provides essential sulfur compounds and sweetness.2
Parsnip: Used as a direct substitute for carrots. Parsnips contribute a complex, woody sweetness and help to balance the earthiness of the celeriac while remaining color-neutral.2
Leek Tops: The dark green tops of the leeks are the most flavorful and sulfur-rich part of the plant. While often discarded because they are too fibrous for soup, their toughness is an asset in a long extraction, where they provide a deep allium backbone.25
Secondary Umami and Aromatic Enhancers
To elevate the stock to a "master" level, additional white-spectrum umami boosters should be integrated. These ingredients provide depth without compromising the blanc profile.
Mushroom Stems: Specifically from white button or cremini mushrooms. They are rich in guanylate and glutamate, which significantly enhance the perception of meatiness in the poultry.6
White Peppercorns: Used whole to provide a clean, sharp heat that does not leave the black specks associated with black pepper.30
Cloves: A traditional French addition to white stocks, providing a subtle aromatic "lift" that cuts through the richness of the chicken fat.30
Bouquet Garni: A bundle of fresh thyme sprigs and dried bay leaves, which are the standard herbal pairings for both chicken and leeks.1

The Mechanics of Extraction: A Comprehensive Algorithm
The production of a masterful stock requires a meticulous approach to cleaning and thermal management. The following steps must be followed with precision to ensure clarity and concentration.
a) The Blanch and Refresh Protocol
Clarity in a white stock is achieved by removing the blood and denatured proteins from the poultry before the primary extraction begins.
Place the whole chicken and the pound of wings in a large stockpot and cover with cold tap water.1
Bring the water to a rapid, rolling boil. Maintain the boil for 3 to 5 minutes. During this time, a gray, foamy "scum" will rise to the surface; this is the proteinaceous material that causes cloudiness.33
Drain the pot entirely and discard the blanching water.
Rinse the chicken and wings under cold running water. Use a brush or fingers to remove any remaining coagulated bits from the chicken cavity and joints.5
Thoroughly wash the pressure cooker pot to ensure no protein residue remains on the interior walls.4
b) Botanical Preparation and Purification
The vegetables must be prepared to maximize surface area while ensuring no grit is introduced, particularly from the leek tops.
Leek Top De-Gritting: Slice the dark green leek tops lengthwise into quarters. Submerge them in a large bowl of cold water and agitate vigorously. Sand and soil, which are often trapped in the inner layers, will sink to the bottom. Lift the leeks out and repeat the process with fresh water until no sediment remains.28
Celeriac Paring: Use a chef’s knife to cut the thick, knobby skin away from the celeriac. Peeling is insufficient for this root; the outer 1/4 inch must be removed to reach the clean, white flesh. Cut the celeriac into 1-inch cubes.24
Parsnip and Onion: Peel the parsnips and slice into 1-inch rounds. Peel the white onion and cut into quarters. To keep the cloves from getting lost, pin them directly into one of the onion quarters (the oignon piqué technique).2
Mushroom Prep: Wipe the mushroom stems clean of any substrate or peat moss. Leave them whole or halved.30
c) Pressurized Extraction Sequence
The core of the process involves the careful management of the 12 PSI thermal curve.
Combine the blanched poultry, prepared mirepoix blanc, mushroom stems, white peppercorns, and bouquet garni in the pressure cooker pot.
Add cold filtered water until the ingredients are just covered. Do not exceed the "Max Fill" line of the vessel, as this can cause the pressure valve to clog with protein foam.7
Secure and lock the lid. Set the pressure setting to high (12 PSI).
Apply medium-high heat until the vessel reaches full pressure. As soon as the regulator indicates 12 PSI has been achieved, reduce the heat to the lowest possible setting that maintains the pressure.4
Set the timer for 120 minutes (2 hours). This duration is optimized for a whole bird at 12 PSI to ensure the marrow is fully extracted.4
Critical Step: At the end of the 120-minute cycle, turn off the heat and allow the pressure to release naturally. This process (NPR) takes approximately 30 to 45 minutes. Never use the quick-release valve; the sudden drop in pressure will cause the stock to boil violently, emulsifying the fat and destroying the clarity.7
d) Refining and Lipid Management
The stock must be filtered and de-fatted to ensure it does not overwhelm the delicate leek flavor with heavy grease.
Carefully open the lid once the pressure indicator has fully dropped.
Using a slotted spoon, gently lift out the large solids and discard them. Do not squeeze the vegetables or chicken, as this will release fine particulates into the liquid.33
Strain the liquid through a fine-mesh sieve lined with cheesecloth or a nut milk bag into a large bowl. For the highest degree of clarity, do not pour the last half-cup of liquid if it contains heavy sediment.4
Rapidly cool the stock in an ice bath to preserve its fresh flavor.11
Refrigerate the stock overnight. The chicken fat (schmaltz) will rise to the top and solidify into a hard, white disk.
Lift the fat disk off and discard it (or save for sautéing the leeks for the soup). The resulting liquid should be a pale, translucent jelly—this is the sign of a master-level extraction.1
The Biochemical Impact on Potato-Leek Gastronomy
The resulting stock is a highly concentrated solution of Type II collagen and aromatic volatiles. In a potato-leek soup (such as Vichyssoise or Potage Parmentier), the interaction between the stock and the starch is the defining technical characteristic.
Starch Stabilization and Gelatin Viscosity
When potatoes are simmered in this stock, the gelatin acts as a hydrocolloid. As the starch granules hydrate and swell, the gelatin provides a protective matrix that prevents the granules from bursting and releasing too much amylopectin into the liquid.14 This is especially important if the soup is to be blended. A water-based potato soup often becomes "gummy" when processed in a high-speed blender; however, a gelatin-rich stock provides the structural integrity necessary to maintain a silky, cream-like texture without the need for excessive dairy.7
The Flavor Profile of Mirepoix Blanc at 115°C
Cooking mirepoix blanc under pressure at  creates a different flavor profile than atmospheric simmering. Under pressure, the sulfur compounds in the leek tops and onions are forced back into the liquid rather than escaping as steam.8 This results in a stock that has a more profound "allium" punch, which perfectly mirrors the primary flavor of the leeks in the soup. The celeriac and parsnip provide a base of sweetness and earthiness that rounds out the sharp notes of the alliums, creating a "long" finish on the palate.2
The inclusion of mushroom stems is a modernist technique to increase the density of natural glutamates. Because leeks and potatoes are relatively low in protein, the mushroom-enriched chicken stock provides the necessary "umami weight" to make the soup feel satisfying as a main course.6 By using white stems, the chef ensures that this depth is achieved without darkening the soup's final color.
Conclusions on Mastery and Execution
A master stock is not merely an ingredient but the structural foundation of the final dish. By utilizing the 12 PSI pressure environment, the chef can achieve a level of gelatin extraction in two hours that would otherwise take a full day of traditional simmering. The specific substitution of celeriac and parsnip, combined with the rigorous blanching of the whole chicken and wings, ensures a product that is both aesthetically pure and physically robust. This stock provides the essential viscosity, umami, and aromatic complexity required to elevate a standard potato-leek soup into a world-class gastronomic experience. The focus on lipid management and sediment filtration ensures that the final soup remains elegant, clear, and focused on the bright, sweet interplay of the leek and the potato.


===================================================
SOUP PREPARATION 
===================================================

1) prepare for ingredients
    a) thinly slice the leeks (750g)
    b) dice the yellow onion (100g)
    c) thinly slice the shallots (1/2 cup)
    d) mince the 3 cloves garlic (~1 tbsp)
    e) create a cartouche
    f) cube the potatoes, 1/2 inch, ~3.3 lbs (after peeling)
    g) create a bouquet garni of the bay leaves / thyme / parsley 

2) render the bacon fat 
    a) fry 5 strips of bacon in a triple-ply stainless steel soup pot  
    b) keep 2 tbsp of the bacon fat, discard the rest
    c) put the bacon in the fridge for garnish later

3) sweat the aromatics
    a) turn the heat on medium-low, the pot should be ~285F
    b) add to the pot:
        - 3 tbsp butter 
        - 1.5 tbsp olive oil (layering these fats ensures it doesn't taste all like bacon or butter)
    c) once the butter begins to foam, add the following: 
        - leeks 
        - onions 
        - shallots 
    d) stir to coat the vegetables in the fat 
    e) add 1/2 tsp salt (this facilitates osmosis)
    f) add the cartouche 
    g) sweat the vegetables for 15 minutes 
    h) add the minced garlic
    g) cook an additional 2 minutes, until the garlic is translucent. 
        If the garlic starts to develop color, add stock to lower the surface temperature.


4) add the potatoes 
    a) add the cubed yukon gold potatoes to the pot 
        stir them in and mix everything
    b) cook for 3-5 minutes. 
        coating the potatoes with fat helps protect their surface, preventing them from disintegrating in the broth later.

5) simmer
    a) pour 2.5 quarts of chicken stock into the pot
    b) bring the mixture to a boil
    c) reduce heat to low
    d) simmer between 185-205F (the potatoes will cook without being tossed too aggressively, keeping them intact)
    e) simmer partially covered for 30-40 minutes
        the potatoes must be soft enough that they crumble when pressed against the side of the pot with a spoon
    f) halfway through add 1 tsp salt

6) rice the potatoes 
    a) remove the bouquet garni 
    b) trasnfer the potatoes to a large bowl (soup them out) 
    c) blend the rest of the soup with an immersion blender until smooth 
    d) strain the soup through a fine-mesh seive to remove any remaining fibrous allium strands
    d) press the cooked potatoes through a potato ricer directly into the strained broth. 
        use the finest setting on the ricer (ensure every bit of potato is aerated with minimal shear). 
    e) use a hand whisk to mix riced potatoes with the broth. 

7) add the dairy
    a) in a small saucepan, warm 1/2 cup of heavy cream to 140F 
    b) cube 2 tbsp of butter
    c) take the soup pot off the heat, and wait until it's ~160F 
    d) whisk in the cubed butter 1 at a time
        160F is hot enough to melt the butter but low enough to maintain a stable emulsion
    e) whisk in the warmed cream
    f) whisk in the 1/2 cup buttermilk 
    g) add the 1.5 tbsp white miso

8) season to finish
    g) add the white pepper, 1 tsp
    h) add the nutmeg, 1/4 tsp
    i) add 1-2 tsp of salt to taste 
    j) stir in 1 tbsp fresh lemon juice 

===================================================
SERVING
===================================================

The ideal serving temperature is 160F.
    At this temperature, the aromatic compounds of hte leek are most active, and the butter is at its most palatable. 

If in season, a few shavings of black truffle or a drizzle of truffle oil (not synthetic) can elevate the flavors. 

You can also serve it with the bacon that was cooked earlier. 

THe soups the starches will continue to retrograde as the soup cools. 
    This often results in the soup becoming significantly thicker in the refrigerator
    When reheating, because the starch has tightened, the soup will require a splash of stock or milk to return to its consistency.

To prevent bacterial growth and maintain color, the soup should be cooled in an ice bath if possible.
Potato-based soups generally do not freeze well.
    The cell walls collapse and the emulsion separates during the freeze-thaw cycle, resulting in a grainy texture.
