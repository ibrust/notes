BROTH 
=============================================

Using the broth generator for my chicken soup this is what I got (it actually looks great): 
    cooking method: pressure cooker
    broth type:  regular broth
    extra aromatic:  Fennel 
    extra herb:  Marjoram (dried)
        add toward the end of the soup making process, in the last 10-15 minutes of simmering. 
        Start with adding about 1/2 tsp dried per quart of soup, then adjust if needed 
        If it was fresh you'd start by adding 1 tsp per quart,
            and you'd add it it in the last 5 minutes (or even right before serving) to preserve the freshness
    extra herb:  Peppercorns
        Added during the broth making stage, at the beginning. 
        Strain them out with the rest of the solids when the broth is done. 
    extra umami:  Roasted Bones
    extra acid:  Lemon Juice
        Add this right before serving, at the very end. It's acidic and volatile, 
            if you add it too early it can lose flavor and become metallic tasting / overly sour
        Usually you add about 1-2 tsp per quart of soup. 
            You can also provide lemon wedges so people can adjust it themselves.
        Apparently this enhances herbs like Marjoram or Parsley, which is perfect. 
    parts to use:  Whole Chicken

    AIs recommendations for every 4 cups (1 quart) of water: 
        1 cup yellow onion (chopped) 
        1/2 cup celery (chopped) 
        1/2 cup carrot (chopped) 
        1/2 cup fennel (chopped)

EXPERIMENTAL INGREDIENTS
=============================================

My Experimental Ratios
This has more noodles & dill, and less onion / celery. 
It is a bit heavy on the garlic as well. 

1 whole chicken, about 4 lbs
7 & 1/3 cups chicken broth (maybe drink or remove 2/3rds of a cup after you make it for 8 cups)
3 carrots
2 & 1/3 stalks celery 
6/10ths yellow onion 
5 cloves garlic 
4 cups dry, medium egg noodles 
3 tbsp olive oil (for sauteing vegetables) 
3 sprigs fresh thyme 
5 tbsp dill 
1 bay leaf
salt & pepper to taste 

AIs Balanced Suggestion: 
chicken, 2-2.5 lbs (thighs, breasts, or whole chicken)
8 cups chicken broth 
2-3 medium carrots
2-3 stalks celery 
1 medium yellow onion 
2-4 cloves garlic 
3 cups dry, medium egg noodles 
1-2 tbsp olive oil (for sauteing vegetables) 
3-4 sprigs fresh thyme 
1-2 bay leaves
2-3 tbsp dill 
salt & pepper to taste 
1-2 tbsp lemon juice (optional)

INGREDIENTS

Spaetzle egg noodles from Europe are a good option:

Special Ingredients: 
    1) Parmesan rind: Simmer in broth for savory depth; remove before serving. 92/100 
    2) Leeks: Substitute for or add to onions for a milder flavor. 37/100 
    3) Some kind of pepper: 
        a) red pepper flakes - 60/100 - add carefully and in layers. They’ll sharpen and brighten your roasted-bone, fennel-forward broth and play beautifully with marjoram and lemon when used with restraint.
        b) aleppo pepper - 75/100  - milder, fruitier; for a smoky-fruity heat without overpowering the fennel/marjoram 
        c) pink peppercorns (not very hot) - 98/100 - to echo the whole peppercorns you used in broth for gentle warmth and floral lift.

        Recommendation
        Use Aleppo pepper as your primary heat, with a small finishing pinch of crushed red pepper flakes for adjustable lift if you want more bite at the table. Avoid using pink peppercorns as the main heat source here; instead use them as an optional garnish or gentle floral counterpoint when you want a peppery, non-spicy accent.

        Why this combo suits your ingredients
        - Aleppo pepper brings moderate, fruity, slightly tangy heat that blends with sweet aromatics (leeks), the anise hints from fennel, and the umami from the Parmesan rind without stealing the show.
        - Crushed red pepper flakes deliver a more one-dimensional, more intense heat; adding a very small finishing pinch lets you tailor heat per bowl without overcooking those sharper notes into the broth.
        - Pink peppercorns are not very hot; they give floral, berry-like notes rather than spiciness, so they’re best used sparingly as a finishing accent on individual bowls rather than stirred into the pot.
        (Short version: Aleppo = base warmth and complexity; red pepper flakes = optional finish; pink peppercorns = delicate garnish.

        But I feel like using Pink peppercorns is better since it won't entirely alter the soup, and seems like a nice garnish. 


    4) parsley: Stir in at the end for a fresh, herbal note.
    5) Mushrooms: Sauté and add for umami


_____________________________________________________

steps to making a whole chicken noodle soup: 

1) cut up the chicken 
    a) remove the legs - cut the skin on the top side of the leg, then pop the joint out and cut through 
    b) take the breasts off (see video on how to make stock)
    c) cut up the carcass (look into it)

2) put the stuff in the pot for the stock 
    a) put the legs and carcass cuts into a pan, but not the breasts. 
    b) put carrots (cut small, washed but not peeled) in the pot 
    c) put the whole celery in the pot 
    d) put the outside of the leeks in the pot (save the inside, it's sweeter. rinse the leeks very well, cut them and half and wash them to get the sand out - watch his leek video on how to do it)
    e) put the onion in there 
    f) fresh thyme and whatever else is going in there. he put bay leaves, parsley (including stems), he put 14 peppercorns, some garlic cloves (he put 8)

    you don't need to saute these, since it's just the stock 

3) cover the bones about 1.5 - 2 inches in water 

4) bring it to boil, then reduce it down to the correct temperature (barely simmering) 

5) let it cook for the prescribed time - he says 60-75 minutes 

6) now sweat the peeled carrots / onions / celery / white part of the leek, etc.. exact order I'm not sure of, look into it 

... (continue later)
