5) vegetable broth 
6) shellfish broth 

=================================================
3 TYPES OF CHICKEN BROTH 
=================================================

1) chicken broth: 
    mostly from chicken meat w/ some bones, vegetables, and aromatics 
    simmered for a relatively short period (1-3 hours)
        but note that, beyond 45-60 minutes, most flavors are extracted other than what's in the bone. 
        And you want to avoid overcooking some of the vegetables. 
    The result is a light, clear, and flavorful liquid, ideal for soups where a delicate chicken flavor is desired

2) chicken stock: 
    mostly from chicken bones, little to no meat
    often roasted, then simmered for a longer period (4–6 hours)
    The focus is on extracting gelatin and minerals from the bones, resulting in a richer, more viscous liquid with a subtle chicken flavor 

3) bone broth
    chicken bones, often with the addition of vinegar to extract more collagen / gelatin / minerals. 
    simmered for an extended period (12–24 hours or more)
    The result is a health food 

=================================================
ROASTING THE BONES / AROMATICS FOR BROTH
=================================================

This roasting is done before simmering. 
It enhances flavor due to the Maillard reaction.

Steps: 
    1) Spread cleaned bones (back, wings, neck, feet, carcass) on a baking sheet. 
    2) Drizzle with oil & season lightly
    3) Roast at 400-450F for 40-60 minutes, turning once, until deeply golden 
    4) 20-30 min before done add onions (with skins), carrots, celery, garlic to the roasting pan

    Avoid burning bones or vegetables, as this can impart bitterness. Monitor closely, especially with smaller bones or thin vegetables

=================================================
SAUTEING OR SWEATING AROMATICS 
=================================================

This is another technique that builds flavor. It releases essential oils / caramelizes the sugars. 

- Sweating (low heat, no browning): Yields a subtle, sweet, and aromatic broth.
- Sautéing (medium heat, light browning): Adds deeper, more complex flavors. 

Cultural Variations include:
    1) Mirepoix (French): 
        2:1:1 ratio of onion, carrot, celery. 
        Sauted in butter. 
        Sweated, not browned. 
    2) Soffritto (Italian): 
        Onion, carrot, celery, often with garlic and parsley. 
        sautéed in olive oil. 
        Often lightly browned.
    3) Suppengrün (German): 
        Carrot, leek, celery root, parsley root. 
        simmered whole, not sauted. 
    4) Holy Trinity (Cajun): 
        Onion, celery, green bell pepper.
        sometimes browned. 
    5) Zazharka (Ukrainian): 
        Onion, carrot, tomato paste. 
        Sauted in sunflower oil or lard.
        sometimes browned. 

=================================================
COOKING METHOD
=================================================

There are 3 cooking methods: 
1) Stovetop simmering in water
    2–3 hours yields a balanced flavor. 
    4–6 hours yeilds a gelatin-rich, deep flavor. 
    Maintain temperature at 180-200F. Avoid boiling, which emulsifies fat & proteins 
    Skim foam / impurities during the first 30 minutes 
    It's easier to adjust aromatics & season during cooking this way. 
    Be sure not to allow excess evaporation or over-reduction 
2) Pressure cooker 
    very fast - typically 20-30 minutes, or up to 2 hours for bone broth 
    produces a rich, concentrated broth with intense flavor 
    advantages are speed, and efficiency at extracting collagen / nutrients
    it's harder to skim things off, though you can skim before you seal the pressure cooker
3) Slow cooker (crockpot) 
    typically takes 8-12 hours for chicken stock, or up to 24 for hours for bone broth 
    results in a deep, mellow flavor 
    very good for extracting collagen / minerals
    also allows you to cook unattended
    again it lacks control over skimming

=================================================
FLAVOR CUSTOMIZATION
=================================================

Aromatic Vegetables - The classic mirepoix (onion, carrot, celery) is the backbone of Western broths, but many variations exist:
    - Leeks:            Add sweetness and subtle onion flavor
    - Parsnips          Earthy sweetness
    - Fennel            Anise and licorice flavors
    - Mushrooms         Deep, savory umami
    - Garlic            Savory, pungent aroma
    - Tomato            Adds acidity and color (especially in brown stocks)
    
    Avoid strong-flavored vegetables (broccoli, cabbage, Brussels sprouts) as they can overpower and add bitterness

Herbs - These infuse broths with freshness and complexity. Use fresh or dried, but note that dried herbs are more potent.
    - Parsley
    - Thyme
    - Rosemary (use sparingly)
    - Bay Leaf
    - Sage 
    - Oregano
    - Marjoram
    - Tarragon
    - Dill

Spices - can transform the flavor profile and evoke global traditions:
    - Peppercorns
    - Coriander
    - Star Anise
    - Cloves
    - Cinnamon
    - Ginger
    - Turmeric
    - Smoked Paprika

Layering aromatics, herbs, and spices allows you to tailor the broth to your desired cuisine and flavor profile. 
Add in stages for complexity; finish with fresh herbs or acid for brightness.

=================================================
Umami
=================================================

Umami - the "fifth taste" - is the key to a deeply satisfying broth. 

Several ingredients can amplify umami:
    - Roasted Bones                             Roasting increases glutamate content.
    - Dried Mushrooms (Shiitake, Porcini)       Add at start, whole or as powder.
    - Kombu (Dried Kelp)                        Add at start. Essential in Japanese dashi; adds glutamates / minerals.
    - Miso Paste                                Fermented soybean paste; adds umami, salt, and subtle 
                                                    sweetness (add at the end to preserve probiotics).
    - Soy Sauce / Fish Sauce                    Salty, savory, and complex; use sparingly.
                                                    (Stir in a tablespoon of this or miso at the end)
    - Parmesan Rind                             Adds nutty, cheesy umami and body. 
                                                    (drop a rind in during simmering)
    - Tomato Paste                              Adds depth and color.

=================================================
ACIDS
=================================================

- Lemon Juice/Zest                              Add at the end for a fresh, vibrant lift
- Vinegar (Apple Cider, White Wine, Rice)       A splash helps extract minerals and balances flavors.
- Tomato (Paste, Fresh, or Canned)              Adds acidity and color.
- Wine (White or Dry Sherry)                    Adds complexity and subtle acidity.

Acidic additions are especially effective in rich or fatty broths, 
    or when the soup tastes flat despite adequate seasoning
Add acid gradually and taste as you go. Too much can overpower

=================================================
CHICKEN PARTS TO USE 
=================================================

The choice of chicken parts affects flavor, texture, and nutrition: 
    - Whole Chicken
        Yields a balanced broth with both meat and bone flavors; 
        ideal for classic chicken noodle soup.
    - Bones-Only (Backs, Necks, Feet, Wings)
        Produces a gelatin-rich, deeply flavored stock; less meaty flavor.
    - Carcass (Leftover Roasted Chicken)
        Adds roasted flavor and is economical; can be combined with fresh bones for depth.

=================================================
MISC OTHER
=================================================

- it's good to skim foam and fat during the first 30 minutes of simmering

- Cool broth rapidly to prevent bacterial growth. Use an ice bath or shallow containers.
- Refrigerate for up to 4 days; freeze for up to 6 months.
- Chill before storing to easily remove fat cap.

- International chicken broth examples: 
    Vietnamese Pho Ga
        Simmers the chicken with ginger, onion (charred), star anise, cinnamon, cloves, and fish sauce
    Japanese Ramen (Tori Paitan)
        Pressure-cooked chicken bones, sometimes blended for a creamy, opaque broth; kombu and dried shiitake for umami
    Greek Avgolemono
        Chicken simmered with aromatics; finished with egg yolk and lemon for a creamy, tangy soup
    Mexican Caldo de Pollo
        Chicken simmered with garlic, onion, cilantro, cumin, and lime.
