- I prefer baking bacon. 320F seems reasonable...
- it can take 20-35 minutes depending on how much bacon is on the pan, how thick the bacon is, etc.
    look for the bacon to be bubbling 
    I like to put about 6 bacons per rack. More I've found takes too long to cook
- it's better to put the bacon in before heating the oven 
- i've found you don't really need to turn it, but it can be good to switch the edge bacons with the middle ones
