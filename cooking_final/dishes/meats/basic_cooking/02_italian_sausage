ITALIAN SAUSAGE
===================================================

The Italian sausage is a meat emulsion consisting of ground pork, lipids, water, and seasoning, 
    encapsulated within a semi-permeable membrane.

Most good store-bought varieties use pork shoulder, which is 20-30% fat.
    The fat serves as the main conduit for flavor and lubrication. 
    Without enough fat, the protein matrix becomes a dense mass after it's denatured by heat. 

The structural stability of the sausage is primarily dictated by the protein myosin.
    When the sausages are made, salt is added. 
    Salt helps dissolve the myosin. 
    This facilitates the formation of a sticky, interconnected lattice that holds the meat together and traps moisture.
    For store-bought sausages, this pre-established protein matrix provides the sausage a certain bounce or snap to it. 
        This bounce must be preserved through the cooking process. 

The casing is typically derived from small intestines or manufactured from processed collagen. 
    As the internal temperature of the sausage rises, the casing contracts, exerting inward pressure on the meat fibers. 
        This pressure is essential for the final texture. 
        Likewise, a breach in the casing will lead to loss of internal fluids and flavor. 
            It's very important to avoid puncturing this casing. 

It's also essential to accurately determine when the sausages are done. 
    You cannot rely on visual assessment of browning due to the presence of nitrates, sugars, and varying PH levels. 
    A thermometer is the only reliable way to know. 


As the sausage moves through temperature ranges its behavior changes: 

    - 120-140F: 
        The myosin begins to coagulate
        The casing starts to shrink and apply pressure
        The meat begins to turn opaque, but the fat has not yet fully rendered.

    - 140-150F: 
        Collagen begins to soften
        Proteins reach a state of firm elasticity.
        This is the optimal range for initiating the final searing phase.

    - 155F: 
        The ideal "pull temperature" to account for carry-over cooking (a result of a temperature gradient within the sausage)

    - 160F: 
        Pathogens are eliminated 
        The final target for safe consumption

    - 165F+: 
        Proteins contract, resulting in a dry, crumbly texture. 


It's a common myth that sausages should be pricked or scored before cooking to prevent explosions. 
    Good store-bought italian sausages contain minimal water and fillers, and are not likely to explode. 
    When the casing is punctured, the pressurized environment inside is compromised.
        The rendered fat and intracellular juices (which contain most of the flavor) are expelled. 
        This not only dries out the meat but also creates a messy, carbonized residue in the pan. 
        Keep the casing intact so that the sausage can poach in its own juices. 

    Unlike pre-cooked hot dogs, which have a homogeneous, pre-set texture, italian sausage depends on the casing 
        to hold it together. They should always be cooked intact. 

A major obstacle is that the exterior browns faster than the interior cooks.
    To address this we'll use the "poach and sear" method


Achieving the Maillard reaction requires that we manage the amount of water on the surface of the casing. 
    You won't be able to brown the sausage as long as its surface is wet due to evaporation. 
    We'll pat dry the surface of the sausage before putting them in the pan. 

    The rate of the Maillard reaction can also be manipulated by adjusting the PH of the surface. 
        Amino acids are more reactive in alkaline environments. 
        Advanced techniques involve lightly brushing the casting with a highly diluted solution of baking soda, 
            or incorporating it into a poaching liquid, which accelerates browning at lower temperatures,
            allowing for a shorter sear time. 
            This reduces the risk of overcooking.

PREPARATION 
===================================================

1) heat a triple-ply stainless steel pan on medium-low until it reaches ~225-250F
    if the pan is too hot it'll cause the bottom of the sausages to cook faster and bow.  

2) place the sausages in the pan and quickly add liquid (water or stock) until about half submerged.
    The water prevents the exterior from burning while the interior climbs toward the target temperature.

2) bring the liquid to a gentle simmer (180-190F).
    this may take 3-4 minutes. 
    keep the lid off.
    simmering (rather than boiling) ensures the heat is transferred more evenly through the links 

3) simmer until the temperature reaches 145-150F. 
    This usually takes 6-8 minutes

3) sear both sides 
    i) pour off the remaining liquid or allow it to evaporate if it won't take long 
    ii) add a small amount of oil (such as ghee) to the pan 
    iii) increase the heat to medium-high (375-425F)
    iv) it usually takes 2-3 minutes per side.
            since we're almost at the target temperature the sear is a bit brief.
