# go w/ 1.33 cups water per cup of couscous 
# I've seen some people say 1:1, someone else say 1:1.5, but dice think it's about 1:1.33

# how hot to make water? 
# 211 - almost exactly boiling 

# how long to let it sit after pouring liquid onto couscous? 
# 6 minutes apparently... some say 10, I've seen 5 elsewhere... we can try 6. we do have more water...


# should we toast the couscous 2-3 minutes? 45/100 - maybe it seems
