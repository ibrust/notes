Switched to the oven method about five years ago and never went back. 
    350 degrees for about 20-25 minutes, perfect bacon every time.

bacon fats smoke point is about 325, so I'm hesitant to do what some people advise - cook it at 400. 
    I'm going to try 350 for 20 minutes, flipping it halfway through. 

some people use parchment paper / a baking rack. 
    I'm not sure whether I'll need that, we'll see. 
    looks like it's mainly for cleanup purposes. I'm not too concerned. 

many people who pan fry recommend starting with a cold pan. 
    but general consensus is baking is a more reliable method. 

what someone else said: 
    You should cook bacon at around 170°F. It renders the fat perfectly. Anyone cooking bacon above 375°F knows nothing about cooking or temperatures that fat burns. Real bacon grease is clear you all burn stuff on the regular.

that's what I was wondering about. 
maybe try putting it below the smoke point at some point. 

this person also cooks it at lower temp:

    they recommend 275 for 30 minutes or longer. 
    let's try that. 

dice say 335F is the way to go. 
    hmm... ok, let's try that. It's close to the smoke point, at least. 
    let's check it after 10 minutes, then 20 minutes. 
    aiming for around 22 minutes (going by the dice). we'll see how it goes. 

    by 13 minutes they actually seemed pretty done, but not quite there. 
    depends on the thickness of the bacon. not sure what this bacons thickness was. maybe average. 

    I ended up taking it out early. It was in there like 16 minutes altogether and it looks done to me. 

    the bacon was very slightly burnt, but typical for bacon and it wasn't bad. 
        however I do want to try this 300 or 275 method at some point. 

    tasting it... I don't think I would have wanted to cook it longer. 
    it tastes done. it doesn't exactly taste crispy. It's a little soft, but it has the taste of bacon. 
        If I wanted crispy maybe turning the heat up at the end would be the way, not sure. 
        honestly I don't really want to go past the smoke point, and I like how it turned out. 
    I cooked it on the pan, and those baking sheets distribute heat well. maybe that plays a role. 

    overall I'd say this turned out well, but 16 minute seems more than enough for the thickness I had. 

    it's good but could have been slightly more crispy, that's the only thing. 
        maybe try varying the temps (try lower and higher), and try cooking on one of those elevated racks 
            although one chef thinks that dries it out. probably does.
            but then someone else says the rack does make it crispy...  
        where the bacon won't be cooking in its fat. this may allow it to crisp more. 
        you can also experiment with putting it in the oven before heating the oven. 

        could also try cooking just a tad longer for crisp

    this guy uses a similar method, though he goes for 350 and 15 minutes: 
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGixcqWD7Qk
    
    above the smoke point so not ideal but we'll see


rack: 54/100 
cook on sheet (no rack): 56/100 
temp: again dice say 330. so 330-335 seems to be it 
longer: 62/100 
put in oven before preheating: 27/100


I think I like my method. 16 minutes, 335, the baking sheets I use. Preheaded. 
    we can experiment though. 
    rack may be worth experimenting with.

tried cooking another 2, just by themselves. 
    same temp and 15 minutes this time. 
    they cooked much faster. I think it's because they weren't cooking in that much grease. 
    so another strategy might be to use 2 racks, and place less on each. 
    it was a tad drier... but it was also crispy. 
    I sort of liked it a little less dry though.

tried cooking it at 287 for about 25 minutes. It's fine and should contain minimal nitrosamines. 
    I see 275 for 30 minutes also being recommended. 
    for health purposes I probably will do it this way.
