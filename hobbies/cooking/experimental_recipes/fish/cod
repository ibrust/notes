always dry the fish & then season it on both sides 


you can cook it in a variety of ways, which vary based on whether there's skin or not 
for no skin: 
    ideal baking time: 400 degrees for 16 minutes in oven
    ideal frying pan time: try 6 heat on my apartments burner for 8 minutes. 
        people recommend 6 minutes but I got 8, so we'll see... try them both. I also adjusted the heat

    edit: also try 7 heat (new apartment) for 3 minutes on both sides. so a little more heat, a little shorter time... let's see how it does
        this may be more appropriate for a thinner piece of fish... hmm.... something to experiment with 

    tried 5 heat + 7 minutes for a 1.5 inch thick fish (fairly thick). it was good but a tad bit overdone perhaps.  
        enough oil in pan this time though.
        I was surprised at how quickly the thick cod cooked. I had planned 8 minutes, but that would have been too long. 
        It had been warmed to room temperature for a while beforehand though.  
        skin didn't brown though. 

    tried a thinner fish for 6 heat + 6 minutes in pan, but not enough oil and had to add more. It was cooked well, skin browned a bit.
        although the 2nd side got browned better than the 1st side. 

    In both cases I went a minute longer on the initial side then I did the second side. 

    so maybe 7 heat + 6 minutes will more of a browning, we'll see.

for cooking in a pan.... they often dip it in flour & then eggwash 

________________ 
recipe for baked cod without eggwash: 
    salt / pepper (put on cod before baking)
    Chipotle Powder
    optional - Chinese Five-Spice Powder

    400 degrees for 16 minutes in oven, try it

too long I think 
    I see someone saying 135F is the ideal temp for cod. 
    google says 145F. 
    We'll try 145 for safety... but 135 may be plausible at some point.
