400F for 16 minutes - oven baked 


_______________

in a pan: 
    try salt / pepper on the fish, and salt on the skin 

    this time we'll try cooking 5 minutes on the skin side then 3.5 on the flesh side. 
        first 6 minutes medium/high, last 3 medium/low 
        didn't get cooked in the middle, on the skin side, because I had to reduce heat after the skin smoked


she make a good point: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRuF9sc9x2A 
    basically there's an ideal temperature you want to reach internally, 145F. 
    if you go above it the salmon dries out she says. It's sort of the lowest germ-killing temerpature I suppose. 


let's try cutting up the salmon before we bake it this time. 
    more surface area may cause it to bake more evenly. it was not done in the middle last time. 

    gonna try 450 F for 12-15 minutes (depends on the thickness apparently)
        we'll try 13.5 minutes this time 

    she says cooking it at a high heat seals in the juices


apparently king salmon has the highest fat content, and if you wanted to go all-out you'd get king salmon

there's also this person: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uYoqclu6so
    she says, in contrast, a lower temperature is less likely to dry out, so she prefers that method 
    she still thinks 12-15 minutes is the time. interesting. 

surprisingly it's very hard to get consistent times. we'll have to experiment. 
    once we get a better oven... measure the salmons height and try cooking it at different times. 

I put a lemon / olive oil / parsley glaze on it. 
But 450 is beyond the smoke point of olive oil... 
    I don't think the first womans advise was very wise. 
    425 should probably be the max. 
    unless you use Ghee, then you can go higher...

Virgin olive oil smokes at 410. 
    Extra virgin at 375, apparently. 
    Ghee is like 478 or something
