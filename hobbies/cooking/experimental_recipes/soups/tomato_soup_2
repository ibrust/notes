this soup is a spicier indian version of tomato soup I'm working on. 
the new base recipe is: 

    olive oil 
    1 onion 
    2 bay leaves (score 51)
    1 tbsp flour (score 49)
    1 tbsp ginger / garlic paste (score 33)
    1 teaspoon garam masala (score 25)
    1 teaspoon turmeric (score 10)
    1 tablespoon indian chili powder (score 63)
    1/2 cup water (he didn't use chicken stock?) (score 71)
    1 tbsp sugar (score 77)
    salt 
    1/3 cup heavy cream 


    try adding different cheeses & spices with this 
    you're really just creating a spicy tomato soup, many of the same techniques as the previous recipe will apply


    3 random spices to try instead of those listed: 
        Safflower - Mild, Sweet
        Curry Powder - this is literally a mix of ginger, garlic, and turmeric, btw. 
            to be precise: turmeric, coriander, fenugreek, cinnamon, cumin, black pepper, ginger, and cardamom.
            so pretty much everything we're already including
        Flax Seeds - Nutty, Toasty

    remember these were suggested previously: 
        Flax Seeds - Nutty, Toasty
        Cinnamon - incidentally, garam masala has some cinnamon in it, plus black pepper & a couple other things (cumin, coriander, cardamon)

    assuming we've eliminated garam masala, turmeric, and indian chili powder - but will be using some kind of spice to replace the chili powder: 
        Marjoram - Citrusy, Piney, Warm 
        + some kind of replacement spice for the chili powder 

    assuming we eliminated all 3 of those spices but not worrying about whether to replace the chili powder: 
        Chervil	Chervil - Bitter, Minty
        Black Pepper - Earthy, Peppery, Piney, Pungent, Spicy, Warm, Woody

    so... there are many interesting combinations to try here. 
    marjoram is part of the mint family, apparently ...
