1) brown 2 red onions
    11 minutes on 2 in the pan 
    you might want to learn to caramlize them and find a good butter / oil combo, but for now this will work 
    I think they should be red onions, but again we will have to experiment 
2) add in 5 whole cloves of garlic for 1 minute 30 seconds 
3) put in all this: 
    5 chopped carrots
    1 full chopped celery
    28g of tomato puree (chef likes La Valle tomatoes - the name of the brand)
    104g peeled chopped tomatoes (a little over 3.5 28g cans)
    6g tomato paste 
    1 cup chopped basil
    1 tablespoon fresh thyme
    1 tablespoon herb de provence 
    ~4.5 teaspoon salt?
    2 teaspoon pepper
    2/3rds of a container of chicken stock (I'm using Swansons). you can add another more later

4) bring to a boil, then reduce heat and cook for 1.5 hours. low heat with just slow 'blooping' bubbles.

5) now balance the salt / pepper, then acidity, then texture 
    add salt / pepper to taste 
    puree w/ immersion blender
    add a little over 1 cup of cream (he used 38% fat cream, but apparently you want a cream that's pure)
    add ~4 tablespoons of honey (I got real raw honey) 
        taste it to make sure the acidity is neutralized. that's the point of fat / sugar 
    put in the remainder of the 2 containers of stock, maybe leaving out 1/6th of a container. so 1 5/6ths containers total 
        make sure the texture looks right. keep blending the soup until the texture looks right 

tips: 
    *1) get good quality tomatoes. the best possible 
    *2) don't overdo the herbs 
    3) find a precise measurement of salt & pepper to start with 
    4) don't overuse celery or carrots 
    5) use a high quality chicken stock 

tipsx2:
    1) try using the chickenstock paste in less water 
    2) try using a combo of milk and ~1 cup or so cream, not pure cream - need some protein. this might replace the water not used in the stock
