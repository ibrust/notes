always dry the fish & then season it on both sides 


you can cook it in a variety of ways, which vary based on whether there's skin or not 
for no skin: 
    ideal baking time: 400 degrees for 16 minutes in oven
    ideal frying pan time: try 6 heat on my apartments burner for 8 minutes. 
        people recommend 6 minutes but I got 8, so we'll see... try them both. I also adjusted the heat

for cooking in a pan.... they often dip it in flour & then eggwash

    Chipotle Powder
