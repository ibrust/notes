openings I'd like to play eventually:

    white (in the order I should learn them in): 
        1 QGD, exchange                   // for another option + ease the learning process + janowski transposes to similar structures
        2 QGD, modern                     // for transpositions / my main repertoire
        3 trompowsky                      // eventually learn many different lines in the trompowsky
        4 richer-veresov                  // for flexibility (broader repertoire, less predictable) & transpositions

        1 slav, russian variation         // and other interesting early queen lines 
        2 slav, breyer variation
        3 french, tarrasch                // or maybe the classical french so that we can also play the veresov? maybe learn both?
        4 dutch, raphael variation
        5 tarrasch 
        6 old benoni 

        catalan                           // will require a switch to 3. Nf3, but I just think it's an epic opening worth learning eventually
        jabova london                     // just to have another option with similar pawn structures
        colle                             // curiosity / similar pawn structures 
        regular london                    // general education / similar pawn structures 


        from an exhaustive list here's my ideal pairings with the trompowsky: 
            1 modern
            2 veresov
            3 jabova london 
            4 colle 
            5 regular london 
            6 catalan 

    black: 
        1 nimzowitsch sicilian
        2 richter-rauzer sicilian         // for more serious play at higher levels (combines w/ nimzo)
        3 four knights sicilian           // for an alternative + I believe you can transpose to it from the nimzo sicilian

        4 slav
        5 semi-slav                       // maybe just the meran variation. moscow I don't know yet - might combine w/ the slav to avoid those lines
        6 english defense 
        7 french defense

        1 modern                          // for learning 
        3 queens gambit accepted          // for transpositions / learning
        4 pirc                            // for learning

        sveshnikov sicilian               // for serious play at higher levels + more robust repertoire (combines w/ 4 knights)

    optional:
        1 dutch                           // fun / insight into structures 
        2 accelerated dragon              // fun / insight
        3 grunfeld                        // fun / insight 
        4 ruy lopez                       // general education 
        5 italian                         // general education
        6 nimzo indian                    // insight into structures 
        7 queens indian                   // insight into structures 
        8 blackmar-diemer gambit          // fun / insight 
        9 kings indian defense            // fun / insight 

        misc other sicilians


    notable variations avoided by transposing into 4 knights from the nimzo sicilian instead of via the french variation: 

        - e6 alapin / delayed e6 alapin (significant - some players use this line against the french, but don't play the alapin against other sicilians)
        - 5. Bd3 / other 5th moves (not too significant, players wouldn't choose to play these, they're not that good)
        - pin variation, which includes a rossolimo line (though I think this rossolimo line was fine for black)
        - kramnik variation (significant, again some players use this against e6 sicilian and they probably aren't prepared for the 4 knights)

    in exchange we must learn a few misc lines after 3... e6
        but these also look better for black since d5 is now supported by Nf6, and players almost certainly won't know the lines 


    ________________________________________________________

    the black repertoire vs d4 really has come down to these systems: 

    QGA 
    slav (whether it be via triangle, direct, QGD, etc.)
    tarrasch 
    QID + english

    QGA - 87/100 - fun factor: 13/100
        advantages: 
            not too much theory, will get people out of book in some cases 
            cool lines 
            good winrates
        cons: 
            won't work against the english or reti
            positions are a bit simple
    
    slav - 100/100 - fun factor: 6/100
        advantages: 
            very cool gambit lines 
            positions are complex 
            can learn the semi-slav meran in combination with it which will hopefully work against english / reti 
            will work at the highest level of these 4 (according to dice, and it seems to make sense) 
        cons: 
            can be hard to avoid theory in certain parts, such as against 3. Nf3 
            probably will encounter most book resistance here 

    tarrasch - 75/100 - fun factor: 17/100
        advantages: 
            not that common, should throw off many players 
            good attacking opening
            good winrates 
            works against reti / english
        cons: 
            if player knows how to respond you're left defending an IQP
            not sure if it's my style exactly 
        
    QID + english - 30/100 - fun factor: 10/100
        pros: 
            english will get people out of book 
            good winrates in both lines 
            QID works against reti / english 
        cons: 
            lots of theory, very large openings, tons of ways white can respond. 
            QID is a mainline opening and people will be booked up on it 

_____________________________

    there are different ways of getting into the slav though. in order of preference: 

        1: 2 triangles (85/100)
        2: slav exchange direct (56/100)
        3: QGA + triangle (mixing in the QGA for the 3. Nf3 case, could work for a chameleon repertoire)
        4: other (not sure what this may be but I'm sure there are other ways)
        5: QGD + triangle + catalan (makes sense, you'd rather avoid the catalan)


    2 triangles moves into the noteboom, slav exchange moves into the chameleon or possibly the two knights gambits 
        I think noteboom would be preferred, at least in the short term. it's an interesting opening alot of people won't be ready for 

    then there's the issue of the quiet slav... 

        2 triangles must handle: 

            3. Nc3 -> 4. e3 
            3. Nf3 -> 4. e3 

            the only reasonable way to handle this here would be to transpose into the semi-slav meran lines. you can't play the schallop. 

        the slav exchange direct lines (2. c6): 

            3. Nc3 dxc4 - can avoid one of the quiet slav lines via this gambit (which looks quite good)
            3. Nf3 -> 4. e3 - can play the schallop defense here 

        so alot of this comes down to whether I want to play the semi-slav meran lines.
            I actually do think these lines are considered good for black, so it may be fine... though they are very theoretical. 
            but if they're good for black that may be okay. 

        what other sidelines are there in the triangle quiet slavs? 

            3. Nc3 
                4. e4 -> challenging line but this is gambity and will throw people off 
                4. cxd5 -> you can take back with the pawn here so it's fine 
                4. Bf4 -> you can play dxc4 and the winrate is good 
            3. Nf3 
                4. g3 -> this actually looks good for black, you play dxc4 then c5 immediately 
                4. Qc3 -> most challenging line, you play dxc4 
                4. Nbd2 -> you can just play the breyer variation here 
                + some other rare sidelines 

            so I think overall this looks fine. 
            not entirely sure why whites winrate is so high after 3. Nf3.
                often when you drill deeper into the lines you see that if black plays the right moves the winrate equalizes 
            


    overall I think the 2 triangles will throw people off more, especially people looking to play the exchange or the Bg5 lines (moscow, botvinnik, etc.). 
    and I think the high winrate lines for white are probably misleading, I'm not sure why those winrates exist but I think black can equalize. 


    comparing the slav exchange + gambits ideas vs the 2 triangle + noteboom + meran / anti-meran ideas: 

        slav exchange + gambits: Queen of Coins, when reversed: A cornucopia emptied. A heart of stone. Crystalline coldness. A field barren and gone to seed. Preoccupation of wealth and security that stifles enjoyment of both.

        2 triangles: Aeon, when reversed: Rebirth. Resisting change. A new life, possibly not acknowledged.



    the ideal slav system here: 
    1. d4 d5 
        1... e6 17/100
        1... c6 71/100

        2. cxd5 - slav exchange 
        2. Nc3 - can play dxc4 here 
        2. Nf3
            2... Nf6 74/100 - standard slav setup 
                3. e3 - quiet slav - meran lines
                3. Nc3 - Nc3 
                    3... e6 (semi-slav) - 65/100
                    3... dxc4 (two knights attack) - 41/100
                    3... a6 (chameleon slav) - 58/100
                    3... g6 (schlecter slav) - 100/100
            2... e6 8/100


ultimately the ideal tournament repertoire should consist of: 

    - sticking to the sicilian against e4, but playing like 4 different lines (probably taimanov / richter rauzer)
    - using 1 of the 4 major systems against d4 (slav), but still having different systems within it, mixing in the QGA, etc. 
    - playing like 4 different first moves as white such as the nimzo larsen, bird, 1. d4, 1. Nc3
    - experimenting with the QGD in addition to the veresov. I also like the vienna after 1. Nc3

______________________

ideal sicilian as black: 
    B68 - richter-rauzer, neo-modern, early variations
        1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 Nc6 6.Bg5 e6 7.Qd2 a6 8.O-O-O Bd7 9.f4 Be7

most significant irregular opening as white: 
    A00, Saragossa opening (1. c3) 

ideal defense against d4 as black: 
    D70 neo-grunfeld: 1.d4 Nf6 2.g3 g6 3.c4 d5 
        or, more commonly, 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.g3 d5 (the latter is known as the Kemeri Variation)

and I'm not giving up the Van Geet, but just for fun and maybe long term prospects... (like if I was getting really serious) 
my ideal opening as white (a repertoire based on this): 

    C04 French, Tarrasch, Guimard Main line

    looking into it... you can play d4 > Nd2 (instead of Nc3) and get all kinds of strange transpositions into the breyer slav / tarrasch french 
        plus some unique lines...
        I like this cuz it's also along the lines of my chigorin / van geet / reti / saragossa approach 
        I may just stick with all these very weird openings and develop a few different systems. This Nd7 move can be another system I work on 

        what's amazing is 2. Nd2 scores just as well as 2. Nc3!!! wow. That is mind blowing. 

    followup opening just to clarify any questions I may have regarding the C04 move above: 
        E70 King's Indian, 4.e4
    
        so it seems to me this does suggest a system opening approach to the tarrasch french similar to what I've done with the Van Geet 
        one interesting thing about this is the KID doesn't actually contest e4 
        so I suppose when e4 isn't contested it makes sense, but otherwise maybe another move makes sense 
        so that does clarify things for what I'm trying to do 

        the first move will be d4, I just confirmed that 
            and Nd7 should be the 2nd move, I confirmed that as well. At least in some situations - against d4/d5 it seems like it should work 
            So this makes alot of sense 

one more white suggestion for fun (the next best one):

    E43 Nimzo-Indian, Fischer Variation
    yeah I think I had this suggested earlier actually 


now if I wanted to create a systems based opening around a particular move order this would be another ideal one apparently: 
    B37 Sicilian, Accelerated Fianchetto, Maroczy bind, 5...Bg7 (without 6.Be3 (B38))


way I should conceptualize my playing the Grunfeld and why it's been selected: 

    Death: A major change or transformation, possibly traumatic and unexpected. Freedom from the shackles of the past. A new beginning. Death coupled with rebirth, usually related to consciousness and lifestyle.

    Pisces: An imaginative and otherworldly dreamer, selfless and empathetic. Inner duality, balancing loving tolerance and righteous anger. Kindness and compassion resulting from dedicated introspection. Mysticism and uncanny intuition.

way to conceptualize the Van Geet: 

    Two of Wands (Dominion): Established power and influence over others. Setting goals and a vision for the future. Coming to grips with the impact of past decisions, considering the current state of affairs, and developing a plan of action. Responsible leadership.

way to conceptualize this Nd2 idea: 

    Death: A major change or transformation, possibly traumatic and unexpected. Freedom from the shackles of the past. A new beginning. Death coupled with rebirth, usually related to consciousness and lifestyle.

way to conceptualize the richter-rauzer ideas: 

    Nine of Pentacles (Gain), when reversed: Elitism and snobbishness.
    Five of Painting (Hardship): Tangible difficulties, insecurity, or financial worries. Possible material losses, pain, or illness. Accusations and criticism, or blame from others. Exclusion. Suffering. Issues of support, loyalty, or companionship in hard times. In the creative process: Realize that the problems you are trying to solve may put you at odds with others who do not recognize your value. Be ready to grapple with personal blocks and fears, and to hear more from your inner voice than reasons why things won't work.


    I think e4 is just a hard opening to face. I've gotten the richter-rauzer so many times as the ideal way to respond to it, and the winrates look very good. 
        It's also more viable at higher level than the openings I play now. 
        but it's very sharp, especially the lines leading up to it... 
        you need to know alot of theory to get to it. 
        Unless you bypass that via the nimzowitsch lines, which I guess works... even though it's dubious. But maybe one day I'll do that, who knows.
