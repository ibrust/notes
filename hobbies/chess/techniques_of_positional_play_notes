SECTION 1 - RESTRICTING THE OPPONENTS PIECES 
==============================================

pawns can often be pushed to kick the opponents pieces, and this can destabilize the position, leading to an attack. 
    one common example is with a knight on g6 or b6 you can play a4 or h4
        especially if it's also restricted from moving elsewhere, and has to retreat somewhere cramping
        but of course in a real game there's always tons of factors to consider before making a move, so really you just want to notice the possibility 

note that being restricted on space starts to matter less as pieces get traded off 


sometimes combinations of exchanges can setup positional advantages. 
    in one example a combination of exchanges allowed a pawn move to be played that locked a knight out of the game
