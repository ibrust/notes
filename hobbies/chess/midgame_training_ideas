For the midgame we'll start with Simon WIlliams categories and then add 5 or so more of our own 

===================================
=========== EVALUATION ============
===================================

things to focus on improving (in rough order):
____________
PHASE 1 - CORRECTING BAD HABITS / WEAKNESSES
1) recognizing when you're creating vulnerabilities in your own position 
2) evaluating potential sacrifices that underly / contribute to the position
3) evaluating the opponents potential pawn breaks 
4) mastering the opening to where you can reach midgames where you understand the plans and themes 
5) making defensive moves that aren't needed 
____________
PHASE 2 - MASTERING EVALUATION
6) evaluating piece activity, especially with knights; always know the strongest and weakest pieces of both you / the opponent. strategize around that. 
7) evaluating tactical combinations 
8) evaluating pawn structure transformations - both you / the opponents. strategize around that. 
9) evaluating pawn structure. strategize around that. 
10) steinitz rule: identify the greatest weakness in the position and direct ambiguous play toward it
____________
PHASE 3 - FINISH MASTERING THE OPENING
11) midgame planning in all your openings; making a collection of model games for the midgame for the various openings, distilling the ideas
12) look at a wide variety of top GM games and think about the ideas in the games. think about when they work / when they don't work. 

- play longer time controls, at least 30 minute games but daily as well. 
- practice these things. practice what you learn. 



====================================
=========== CALCULATION ============
====================================

- look at checks > captures > attacks 
- try to calculate methodically, each branch one at a time. 
- analyze complex tactical lines or puzzles but without a time control. keep pushing yourself to solve these and you'll get better. 
- sometimes you have time to double check or triple check the calculation

In addition to Simon Williams ideas these are 5 broad areas of the middlegame I should also work on: 

A) Thematic Pawn Structures 
B) Counterplay 
C) Semi-Open Files 
D) Strange Trades and Gambits 
E) Deep Theoretical Analysis of Middlegame Positions
