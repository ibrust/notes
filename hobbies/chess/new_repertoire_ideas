ideal reprtoire ideas: 
black:
- petrov (cool move I haven't looked at much yet)
- paulsen french (if there was a way to incorporate the paulsen french as black it'd be nice)
- old benoni (hmmm... playing against the Nc3 benoni may make you stronger against it as white?)
- sicilian defense - B20 (sidelines other than the open and closed sicilian - so learn your sidelines basically)
- sicilian taimanov w/ 5. Nc3 - B45 - from the french sicilian, alternative to the four knights
- Sicilian, Najdorf, Opocensky Variation - B92 - strange move against the najdorf. Maybe it's worth learning different sicilians. Maybe understanding this move would be useful. 

white: 
- paulsen french (so what I'm doing with the chigorin)
- caro-kann - B15 w/ 3. Nc3 - main line (so maybe figure out a better response to the caro-kann, or work on your existing response)
- bogo-indian defense - maybe defending against this would help me not have to avoid it 
- E54 Nimzo-Indian, 4.e3, Gligoric System with 7...dxc4 - same here. I think this variation is transpositional as well
- B74 Sicilian, Dragon, Classical, 9.Nb3 - interesting way of fighting the dragon 

___________________________

ideal openings to learn for general improvement as a player / positional understanding / etc. 

1) D98 white - Grünfeld, Russian, Smyslov Variation
2) E06 black - closed catalan w/ 5. Nf3 - just mix in the closed catalan for a while, for learning purposes
3) E31 black - Nimzo-Indian, Leningrad Variation, Main line


most my style: 
1) E06 black - closed catalan 
2) C53 black - guioco piano 


_______________

easiest way to get 2000: 
1) E68 w/ white - King's Indian, Fianchetto, Classical Variation, 8.e4
2) D28 w/ black - QGA, Classical Variation 7.Qe2
3) D36 w/ white - QGD, Exchange, positional line, 6.Qc2
4) B10 - caro-kann defense (landed on white but if relevant...?) 
5) E44 w/ white - Nimzo-Indian, Fischer Variation, 5.Ne2

tree thresholds (modified):
at move 2 -> 5%+ 
at move 4 -> 10%+
at move 6 -> 15%+
at move 8 -> 20%+
at move 20 -> 25%+
at move 25 -> 30%+

maybe start with building a tree based around this, and get it as deep as move 20 at least. 
    though really you can probably just keep drilling down until there's no more moves left or not enough games left
    then you can flesh it out afterwards, starting at the base and going lower than 5%, etc. 

    but this doesn't really address how to handle positions that are unique... maybe mark positions as unique and explore them based on instinct. 
        also try expanding the search criteria to increase the number of games / players 

in the next step work toward:
at move 3 -> 5%
at move 6 -> 10%
at move 15 -> 15%
at move 20+ -> 20%

Van Geet specific preferences: 

1... c6 (4%): for now I'm playing my weird sidelines in the main line 
    after I switch to the chigorin vs. d5 I'll play the Jobava london w/ c6 transposition here
1... e5 (8%): Napoleon attack - most brutal variation
1... e6 (5%): Paulsen French via 2. d4 - confuses many people on the way there - most challenging variation I'll face
1... c5 (11%): Two Knights Sicilian (3rd most brutal lines - agreed)
1... Nf6 (22%): Alekhines Scandinavian + Falkbeer Gambit - 2nd most brutal variation (it's also the 3rd most challening... depends on whether they know the lines)
1... Nc6 (2%): Van Geet Berlin Gambit - 2nd most challenging variation I'll face (probably these are nimzowitsch defense players)
1... d5 (34%): Closed Scandinavian for now, but Chigorin Setup later as I get more serious (maybe... this line is just fun though. 4th most brutal lines anyway)
    the only 2 significant lines added by playing the Chigorin setup here are the Irish Gambit and the Alburt Defense 
    and playing the Closed Scandinavian means you probably need to play the Two Knights Caro-Kann or the mainline Caro-Kann
1... d6 (4%): Byrne Variation / a few small Van Geet specific sidelines
1... g6 (7%): Pseudo-Byrne Variation / sidelines (looks the same as the chigorin setup)
1... f6 (1%): Dutch, Raphael Variation 
1... b6 (1%): Owen Defense


overall I think all the lines here are brutal, and I think black is going to be so confused he won't know what hit him. 
    The added complexity is justified by the fact black won't know what's going on and is going to be more vulnerable. 

eventually the goal should probably be to know multiple lines for each one of these moves so that you can play in tournaments

lines that will most throw people for a loop: 
    Berlin Gambit (the non-nimzowitsch players probably) > closed scandinavian lines vs d5 > owen defense > napoleon attack > caro kann lines 

most brutal transpositions: 
    1) closed scandinavian (accidentally end up in a caro kann, french, alekhines scandinavian)
    2) alekhines scandinavian (they wind up in a falkbeer gambit or some weird scandinavian)
    3) owens defense 
    4) dutch, raphael variation 
    5) caro-kann - apparently they just don't know what they're in for 
    6) napoleon attack

    number representing strength of sicilian two knights transpositions: 16/100 
        so people will be actively transposing and successful in doing so often, bear that in mind. 
        still many tricky lines people can fall into. it's more like... if they make it to their chosen sicilian it's because they guided themselves to it. 

most brutal in speed chess: 
    1) caro-kann lines 
    2) van geet berlin gambit 
    3) napoleon attack 
    4) closed scandinavian 

most innovative: 
    1) dutch, raphael variatoin 
    2) closed scandinavian 
    3) byrne variation of the pirc 
    4) two knights sicilian 

best ideas / right ideas: 
    1) napoleon attack 
    2) owen defense 
    3) van geet berlin gambit (great confirmation)
    4) byrne variation of the pirc 
    5) dutch, raphael variation 

thing to most modify and to what degree: 
    1) closed scandinavian, 8/10 - yeah at some point I'll probably play the chigorin, but for now I'm happy with what I have 
        general number to conceptualize closed scandinavian with: 83/100 - so it's a great line anyway. they're all great lines really 

overall number representing the repertoire: 76/100 
I think this will just be my lifetime repertoire though. It's just too epic.

___________________________

Grunfeld: it's extremely complex, and if you don't know the theory... the pawn gets pushed and you have problems. 
    The upside is your opponent has to know the theory as well, and will be confused by the position. 
    So you could think of it as a theoretical battle. 

Slav: 
    You're going to just throw people off and kill them with the lines you've selected. 
    And you could do that the rest of your chess career depending on what your aspirations are. 
    It's an easier approach.

Richter-Rauzer line via d6: 
    it's an amazing opening, the whole classical setup, the only issue is reaching it reliably. You definitely want to play this. 
    but over time you will be able to do that, and you won't mind it. It's not as fun as when you reach the rauzer, but you'll be fine with it. 

nimzo indian (as black): 
    The issue is it is it's been so played, and you have to know so many lines. Lines you're not aware of tracing back 50 years. 
    At that point you're playing someone elses game. 

QGA: 
    it's a good opening it's just not as fun. It's a very typical position, it's not that uncommon 

tarrasch / semi-tarrasch: 
    it's an amazing opening unless your opponent knows the lines, at which point it can be a bit of a druge, but overall it's fine 

semi-slav: 
    it's completely epic, and once you know all the particular moves you'll see how epic it is 

Taimanov: 
    it's a bit easier to play, it's a little more intuitive but you're not going to get the same advantage. 

nimzowitsch sicilian: 
    though in theory people can play the sharp line and get an advantage... it's never going to be a problem. 
    this will throw people off and get you good positions. 
    it can also transpose to the rauzer, so it can be a way to avoid some anti-sicilians like the moscow or the delayed alapin 
    it's a good opening to keep in your repertoire, though it probably shouldn't displace the rauzer but rather compliment it 

_____________________________

I think I'm sticking with the Grunfeld actually. 
Slav is cool too though. 
Maybe try both and see how you feel, but I get multiple good indications for the Grunfeld, and I feel like it's epic. 
slav is epic too, and semi-slav is a long term options as well. 
Hard to choose between them. 
Maybe just try them both for a while. 

______________________________

a more conventional ideal repertoire as white... would be based on: 

E57 Nimzo-Indian, 4.e3, Main line with 8...dxc4 and 9...Bxc4 cxd4

I've gotten this nimzo indian 4. e3 line alot

I suppose the tarrasch french would be added in there. 
Then I could play the QGD exchange. Infact I even got this for the QGD: D35 QGD, Exchange Variation

Then all that's left is the KID (which shouldn't be hard) and the Grunfeld, which I play. 
Yeah, I can see the value of this repertoire.

But what should I do against the slav? That would be the key. 

__________________________

significant sicilian to learn as white: 

B77 Sicilian, Dragon, Yugoslav Attack, 9.Bc4

___________________________

open sicilians frequency: 

rauzer setup via d6: 3.6% 
rauzer setup via Nc6: 2.5% 
so overall about 6% of sicilian games (which are in turn 36% of e4 games) they get a rauzer setup if they're playing the open sicilian. 
    if they play the rossolimo against d6 or something it's going to be less than that 



______________________

classical sicilian - 64/100 - issue with this is if you make one wrong move your opponent may capitalize on it since they'll know the lines more 

nimzowitsch sicilian - 64/100 - you'll be getting your opponents out of book and playing them on a human level, not too many people know these lines, but if you really wanted to climb high elo you'd have to switch to something else

four knights sicilian - 90/100 - if you wanted to play an opening to get people out of book you'd do better with the nimzowitsch sicilian 

taimanov - 5/100 - this is an interesting option, it will get your opponents out of book - many of them, at least. so it avoids the problems you have in the classical where one wrong move is the end of you. it's also more legitimate than the four knights. interesting option 

accelerated dragon - 45/100 - it's a great opening, can be played at the highest level and alot of people don't take it seriously enough. 

petrov - 37/100 - if you put the effort into learning it you'd do very well 

nimzowitsch defense (1... Nc6) - 15/100 - so if you want to play the classical Nf3 Nc6 setup this is just simply a better way of reaching it, you're correct in that analysis. And you don't have to play that way if you don't want to. 

_________________________

downsides the way I see it: 

classical sicilian: 
    - gota face the rossolimo occasionally, and a few other anti sicilian lines (though they aren't too difficult it's still not enjoyable)
    - won't throw good players off 

nimzowitsch sicilian: 
    - the forward e pawn is a bit annoying to deal with even if it's not the mainline position and the engine scores it fine 
    - the mainline, though rare, may become more of a problem at higher elo 

four knights sicilian: 
    - the french sicilian has to face the stronger alapin 

taimanov: 
    - again french sicilian has to face the stronger alapin 

accelerated dragon: 
    - frequently runs into the rossolimo 

petrov: 
    - lines can be sharper and people seem to know them better, more forcing 

nimzowitsch defense: 
    - williams defense isn't really that appealing
    - transposing into the mainline ruy lopez / italian / scotch / four knights positions is a little daunting

____________________

petrov / nimzowitsch sicilian would be effective up until 2400 
taimanov up until 2300 
nimzowitsch defense / four knights defense 2600

nimzowitsch defense most aligns with my chess goals 
petrov would most facilitate capping out at 2400 
four knights sicilian also aligns with chess goals 

positions that feel the best to play: 
    four knights > accelerated dragon > classical sicilian > petrov > taimanov > nimzowitsch defense > nimzowitsch sicilian 

positions that most fit my playstyle: 
    accelerated dragon > nimzowitsch defense > petrov > nimzowitsch sicilian > taimanov > classical sicilian > four knights sicilian 

positions that will most give me the kind of edge over opponents I'm looking for: 
    accelerated dragon > nizmowitsch defense > petrov > taimanov > nimzowitsch sicilian > four knights sicilian > classical sicilian
