whites 1st move comparisons: 

e4 - because black knows the lines it's going to be relatively more of a stalemate situation. 
but it's based on very sound chess principles so the objective position is good for white. 

d4 - it's the opening you really are meant to play. it's positional and you really excel at that. 
actually your repertoire that combines the QGD modern with the trompowsky as quite a good one, 
but I'm sure you can find others as well. you could also learn the kings Indian, there are good lines against it. 

Nc3 - it's offbeat and if they don't know the lines it's perfectly good. you'll often be in positions where you'll get a very direct attack 
against black where he doesn't know the lines 


===================================================================================================
===================================================================================================
BLACK DEFENSES VS. D4
===================================================================================================
===================================================================================================

1) slav - there are alot of really great gambits in these lines. it's also completely sound fundamentally which is good. 
only issue is it can be a little theoretical in certain lines. 
but overall you put alot of pressure on the opponent to play sharply very early in the game. 
it can become kind of a slog some of the time. 

2) QGA - it's at least one of your go-to defenses. the only thing about it is you don't entirely enjoy it, even though it's good. 
sometimes there can be some pressure on your kingside and it can get a little dicey, but nothing too serious. 
sometimes you can also get backed up with an open center, so you have to watch for that. 
overall though it's a good solid way of equalizing, though a bit boring. 
_______
The fundamental reason to prefer the slav is it is more capable of punishing the opponents mistakes than the QGA. 
overall slav is a bit riskier but it can pay off more. 
QGA is going to be more theoretical and solid position but maybe not quite as risky / aggressive. 
ratings not considering the fun aspect: slav - 66, QGA - 53
But I can always experiment with both, the QGA can be an off weapon long term. 
_________
3) benko - it's one of your trump cards. if they know the main line well it can get difficult though. 
but other than that it's completely solid and gives you great initiative. 
it's alot of fun to play as well. 

4) english defense + french defense - another opening you like, another go-to, it puts people under pressure early and they often don't know it. 
there are some surprising attacks that people may not be aware of, they're not obvious. 
the overall system is alot of theory, that's the biggest downside to it. 
some of the theory you can minimize if you also play the french, maybe as an off weapon. 
overall it's a good variation to know, one of the good ones. 

5) vienna - great way of throwing people off. remember it transposes with the ragozin. 
you get alot of pressure early but the pressure can fizzle out if they know the line. 
however there are many funky moves and ways of throwing off the opponent, so overall it's a very funky and offbeat way of playing. 
it could be a defense in your repertoire, though perhaps not the most go-to one. 

6) nimzo-indian - not a line you usually play but it's a good line nonetheless. 
it's alot of theory though that's kind of offset by the fact the position will become chaotic. 
if you wanted to play one of the main theoretical defenses this would be a good choice. 
it'd still be alot of theory but it would nonetehless be your solid theoretical defense. 

7) triangle system - it's not really ideal, you block in your bishop early. 
you're relying on white to accept the gambits and if they do it's alot of fun, but if they don't you can have difficulty. 
that being said you can get wins with this, make no mistake about it. 

8) tarrasch / semi-tarrasch - it's a good opening it just can get a little difficult when they know the fiancetto line or some knight jump lines. 
but they have to know alot of theory to play it right, and you will often have a theoretical advantage. 
overall this is a good way to get a technical game if that's what you want. 

9) QGD - the main issue with this is there's a magic bullet to it, the exchange variation. 
but if you can get the tartakower then it's a fantastic position. 
there are ways of playing it that can avoid the exchange and you need to play those lines. 
if you can manage that then it becomes an awesome position and one of your go-tos for theoretical lines.
however you'll find there's always some tradeoff in trying to achieve that.  

fun factor ratings: vienna > QGD > triangle system > QGA (apparently) > english defense + french defense > benko 

--------------------------

semi-slav - so the issue with this is it's quite alot of theory, it's a very standard position. 
it's also more positional... i.e. it's not quite as sharp early on, it doesn't put white under immediate pressure. 
even though it's alot of fun I would just recommend avoiding it. 

KID - tons of very deep theory, people who study this day and night. 
it's filled with all sorts of strange little moves that you just won't know unless you study the theory. 
it's not objectively great either, it's objectively suffering. 
you also have to play the pirc along with it. just leave it to people who want to play a hypermodern opening. 

grunfeld - it's a very standard way of playing. it can lead to some odd patterns of attack though, but it requires the opponent to play the odd moves. 
your opponent occupies the center and you have to try to undermine it, so white gets alot of space. 
overall I think you're giving away too much space and too much initiative here

dutch - it's a way of avoiding boring games like the london. 
that said I don't think the position is really very good objectively. 
it's similar to the KID in some respects but it's actually a little worse than that. and it's also very theoretical. 
you're really just handicapping yourself from the beginning of the game with the exposed king for not a very big benefit. 

QID - tons of theory here. like whole books worth of theory. it combines very well with the nimzo indian because they can transpose into one another.
overall the position is alot of fun but i'm not sure it's objectively great. there are specific variations that give it trouble.  

ragozin - it's not really a defense you want to play. partly this is because the vienna is just more preferred. 
it can also run into a brick wall if they play the right line. 
at that point it becomes very theoretical and it's not theory you want to study, there's not alot of payoff. 

albin - 

chigorin defense - 

benoni - 

budapest - 

old indian - 


===================================================================================================
===================================================================================================
WHITE VS. CARO-KANN
===================================================================================================
===================================================================================================

preferred lines: 

1) accelerated panov - this just wins alot... when you trade off the pawns and open up the board you get alot of initiative through the midgame as 
you hang on to the pawn. Puts alot of pressure on black to know the right continuations... but it also has a positional aspect to it in the sense
it's less obvious the moves to play in response. Probably my favorite line

2) tal variation - can lead to a very chaotic game that's good for white. The only issue with the tal, and the reason I don't play it primarily... 
is it's very theoretical, and you can expect black to know the theory. But if you don't mind, or if you think you can out-theorize black, 
it's a great position...

3) rasa-studier gambit - the main value of this is it's very offbeat and sharp. it can be a little dubious, so it's a line you have to memorize 
precisely and deeply to play it, but it's very aggressive and you will get alot of free wins if you know the lines. 
Some of the lines early on have 80%+ winrates for white... very good surprise weapon.

4) fantasy - it's a sharp game as well, you get a very ideal attacking setup but you really aren't risking anything... 
you can't be worse. So you're testing black to know the theory... if he doesn't know it you'll do well and if not you're still okay.

5) apocalypse attack - it actually ends up being a positional line with some odd moves, so benefits from knowing the theory, 
at the same time it's a very uncommon and offbeat line... if you like trying to get an edge in a more positional way through superior knowledge 
of theory this is a good line

6) short variation - more positional than the Tal... black doesn't have alot of good options. overall if you want a mainline theoretical positional 
game this is a good way to go
 
7) van der weil attack - it's a good way of playing an offbeat opening that's sound. you should know the theory in these lines but if you know it 
you'll do very well.

8) bayonet attack - this attack is actually quite good. It would be a good off weapon for you to play. you'd need to learn theory of the attack, 
it's a theoretical line. but don't let that prevent you from playing it, it's a good line.

9) 2. c3 - this can actually be a very tricky line if your opponent doesn't know how to play it.

_____________

alien gambit - good line, it's much harder for black to play than the eval suggests... good way of getting a game that's not too theoretical, 
i.e. avoiding the mainline CK with Nc3. So it turns out to be a good line for the Van Geet player... though I actually prefer the rasa-studier for 
this purpose. It's becoming more well known due to streamers such as gothamchess... But I don't think you need to worry too much about the piece sac, 
black is holding on for dear life in many lines

two knights - not a huge fan, I tried to like it but in the end it's too well known, your pieces are backed up or subject to being tempod and it can 
become kind of boring and positional.

hillbilly - the issue with this move order compared with the rasa-studier is the bishop is more vulnerable to harassment, and it's a line they may 
know because the response is simpler. however, it is still very offbeat, so not alot of people will know it but if they do it's just not comfortable. 

Nc3 main lines - it's a good position for white, however it's more theoretical / formulaic and you can expect black to hold on resiliently 
because he knows the theory 

exchange - it's not the ideal line from a theoretical standpoint, but from a practical standpoint as a fighting weapon it can lead you to a good game. 
it's going to be kind of a slog, basically. 

regular panov - it's not just quite the ideal move order to reach the panov due to some specific factors. just play the accelerated if possible. 

goldman - black has a little more initiative than he needs to have in these lines due to tempos on the queen, the queen is vulnerable coming out early 

Bronstein variation - it's a playable position but your knight is just backed up and misplaced

advanced + Nd2 - again you're kind of backed up and it's hard to get much done / maintain the initiative

hector gambit - I just don't think it's sound. 

breyer variation - good way of putting your opponents theory to the test since it's very rare. leads to a queen trade and endgame and so if you like endgames it's also favorable for that. 


===================================================================================================
===================================================================================================
WHITE E4/E5 MOVE 2 POSITIONS 
===================================================================================================
===================================================================================================

1) vienna game - it's a good way of avoiding the petrov. it's going to be your go-to defense irrespective of its objective eval. 
it kind of depends on what variation we're talking about but in general it's a good move. 
it's also more offbeat for players than you realize it is.

2) bishops opening - it leads to good positions for white, though some of the positions are a bit more theoretical than the viennas. 
in those very theoretical lines you can go very deep and really make not much progress due to how often they're played. 
however one upside is it can lead to more positional games which you're good at.
ultimately I think we have to say it's a solid choice. 

3) center game - if you knew the theory very well here it could actually be a great line. 
one issue though is it's kind of forcing. 

kings knight opening (2. Nf3) - your opponent is just going to know every move and follow it precisely, and you're not going to make any progress. 
there are some interesting lines in certain places but you have to go deep. 

kings gambit - so the thing is even though it looks tricky people are still going to know these lines. 
and they're going to know ways of throwing you off, and it's really going to be a nightmare. 

leonardis variation (2. d3) - just never play this. don't play this. 

the whale (2. c4) - it can actually lead to a viable grindy position. the thing is it's kind of forcing and you don't really enjoy the position. 

alapin opening (Ne2) - it's not terrible it's just not the right move order, it'd be better to play Nc3 because you're going to have to play a scotch.

===================================================================================================
===================================================================================================
WHITE E4/E5 BISHOPS OPENING AND VIENNA GANE POSITIONS  
===================================================================================================
===================================================================================================


FINAL ANALYSIS RESULTS (SKIPPING TO THE END): 

VIENNA GAME: 

1) falkbeer g3 + max lange italian: 96
you're getting the play of a traditional ruy lopez or italian, but it's very offbeat and you're also limiting the amount of theory

2) falkbeer gambit + max lange italian: 68 

3) falkbeer g3  + max lange g3: 31

BISHOPS OPENING: 

the ones I found most interesting were: 
1) max lange vienna transposition + falkbeer d3 Bc4 Nc3, delayed vienna transposition - 86 
    kind of an offbeat way of reaching your go-to defense. 
    not as good as the vienna line but still completely viable. 
    in particular you do want to play the gambits in the other vienna line, it'll cut down the amount of theory you need. 
    this line it's going to be more like a traditional theoretical italian in terms of the amount of theory. 

2) max lange d3 > 2 a4's + falkbeer d3 Bc4 a4 - 74
    if you were really serious about playing the bishops opening unique lines this would really be the way to play it 

3) max lange vienna transposition + falkbeer vienna transposition - 73
    again just your go to defense, but this is a nice way of reaching it if you happen to be playing both italians in the vienna 

4) max lange d3 > a4 + c3 + falkbeer d3 Bc4 c3 - 63
    again two structurally similar moves that can combine well together 
    you could kind of develop your theory in these lines and it'd be an interesting repertoire, though I'd prefer a4 

5) max lange d3 > a4 + italian transposition + falkbeer d3 Bc4 Nf3, pseudo-italian - 46
    I wouldn't really recommend this because again it's theory and can be dealt with by some players 

6) max lange immediate a4 + falkbeer d3 Bc4 a4 - 41
    the immediate a4 is kind of extra theory you don't need with no real benefit, you can just deal with the sidelines through the regular move order


So for the actual bishops opening lines I think I agree these win: 
    max lange d3 > 2 a4's + falkbeer d3 Bc4 a4

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) bishops opening, vienna italian transposition (Nc6 > Nc3) - it's primarily aimed at throwing off the opponent. that's the main purpose of this. 
like if they have a specific falkbeer variation line prepared against the vienna you may avoid that. 

2) bishops opening, Nc6 > d3 (with italian transposition) - you're playing a mainline defense but you're kind of disrupting the way black reaches 
the defense. It's better than playing the mainline directly. it's a good way to play if you want to play the italian. 

3) bishops opening, Nc6 > d3 (no italian transposition) - this is a great line. it's complex but you won't be in book. if you know the line 
and the opponent doesn't you're just going to do very well. it's a great way of still playing an italian position, 
but not one that the opponent will know. 

bishops opening, italian, direct transposition (Nc6 > Nf3) - it's just the classical italian game, it's very theoretical but also sound fundamentally. 
but remember you're going to end up in a stalemate with players that know the theory very deeply. 
basically you're going to have to know alot of theory to actually play this. like an enormous amount of theory. 

bishops opening, kings gambit transposition (Nc6 > f4) - you're just giving back the advantage you tried to get here. 


__________

1) bishops opening, Nf6 > Nc3 (vienna transposition) - kind of the critical theoretical line. it's going to be your go-to line here. 
it's pretty good for white in general. 

2) bishops opening, ponziani gambit (Nf6 > d4) - leads to a crazy position. it's generally good for white, but a little bit crazy. 
it transposes with the urusov gambit and then the scotch gambit. So in a way it's a better way of reaching that d4 scotch gambit in the italian.
it could be your go-to defense here, it's actually quite good. 

bishops opening, Nf6 > d3 - it's the main line of this bishops opening after Nf6. So another theoretical italian style variation. 
So even though this is good you do need alot of theory here. 

bishops opening, petrov, italian variation, boden-kieseritsky gambit (Nf6 > Nf3 > Nxe4 > Nc3) - 
here you'll often get an ideal setup but it's also unstable. 

bishops opening, petrov, italian variation, misc other lines (Nf6 > Nf3 > other lines) - 
these are good positions, they're more positional but you can certainly play them. 

bishops opening, petrov, Qe2 line (Nf6 > Qe2) - it's not really a move order you want to play. 

bishops opening, greco gambit (Nf6 > f4) - it just doesn't look right. 

__________

vienna, falbeer, meisis variation (Nf6 > g3) - there's alot of complexity to this line, and it's a good line. 
you can learn the variation where black attacks the center early. 
there's nothing wrong with your position, you're going to have a positional game along the diagonal.
one of the benefits of it is it's pretty unusual, most players go for flashier variations.
the main thing you have to decide is whether to play this or the falkbeer gambit. 
for the e4/e5 context I think g3 will be more effective, but in a van geet context I think the falkbeer gambit will be more effective. 

vienna, falbeer gambit - it's a great line but it gets even better when they don't know the refutation (i.e. via the van geet). 
there's really nothing wrong with the position, it's sound, you can play it and learn it and get great with it, you're not taking risk.
the only issue with it is it requires something against the max lange to pair with it. 
but I would call this your true go-to line in the falkbeer. 

vienna, falkbeer italian (Bc4 > Nf6 > Nc3) - it's kind of risky actually. in a way you're counting on the opponent to make a mistake.
the benefit of it is it can transpose with the other vienna italian, a variation you play. 
you could think of it in terms of a risk vs reward strategy. do you want to play the entire vienna italian or mix and match, that's the question. 

_______________

spanish four knights - against certain variations this can kind of become a slog. I wouldn't really recommend this even though it looks enticing. 

four knights scotch - 

four knights, gunsberg (4. a3) - 

four knights, halloween gambit - 

four knights fiancetto (4. g3) - 

vienna, falbeer, mengarini variation (Nf6 > a3) - 

vienna, falbeer, center attack transposition (Nf6 > d4) - 

belgrade gambit - 

__________ 

vienna, max lange, italian (Nc6 > Nc3) - better way of getting an italian with an advantage since this is an italian people don't play as frequently. 
I think it's a very good opening for you to play, I think your theoretical knowledge will pay off here. 
the one thing to remember is this variation can get complicated quickly, so it's an idea-based opening. 
but you won't go wrong with it, that's a way you like to play and a way you excel. 

vienna, max lange, paulsen (3. g3) - so it can transpose into a position you want to play, 
but this position itself you don't want to play it quite as much. 
the main issue is the kingside is a little unstable in this variation. 

vienna, max lange gambit (3. f4) - it's actually a good variation, it's greatly underestimated. 
you can think of it as basically an improved kings gambit. 
however if black knows the line he can defend and stabilize his kingside, and at that point you don't have much more initiative. 

vienna, max lange spanish (3. Bb5) - will usually transpose into the four knights spanish 

__________________________

COMBINATIONS IDEAS: 

general advice on choosing what to do here: 
you want to throw the opponent off while still having a great playable position. 
ideally you want to avoid theory and develop your own complex theory in the lines. 
you'd rather not lose the bishop and you'd rather be able to rotate your knight to the kingside at some point, if possible. 

bishops opening: 33
vienna game: 36 

it's exactly what I thought... combinations of vienna games: 
1) falkbeer g3 + max lange italian: 96
2) falkbeer gambit + max lange italian: 68 
both g3 moves: 31
falkbeer gambit + max lange gambit: 27
both italians: 17
falkbeer gambit + max lange g3: 16


bishops opening ideas: 
max lange d3 > a4 + c3 - 71
max lange immediate a4 - 65
max lange d3 > 2 a4's - 55
max lange vienna transposition - 55
max lange d3 > a4 + italian transposition - 53

falkbeer d3 Bc4 Nf3, pseudo-italian - 95
falkbeer d3 Bc4 f4 - 84
falkbeer d3 Bc4 a4 - 76
falkbeer vienna transposition - 67
falkbeer d3 Bc4 Nc3, delayed vienna transposition - 62
falkbeer d3 Bc4 c3 - 37
falkbeer urusov line - 5

combinations of bishops games: 

max lange d3 > a4 + c3 + falkbeer vienna transposition - 94 (apparently these combine well even though they're not entirely efficient, but meh)
max lange vienna transposition + falkbeer d3 Bc4 Nc3, delayed vienna transposition - 86 
max lange d3 > a4 + italian transposition + falkbeer vienna transposition - 79
max lange d3 > 2 a4's + falkbeer d3 Bc4 a4 - 74
max lange vienna transposition + falkbeer vienna transposition - 73
max lange vienna transposition + falkbeer urusov line - 64
max lange d3 > a4 + c3 + falkbeer d3 Bc4 c3 - 63
max lange d3 > a4 + c3 + falkbeer urusov line - 57 
max lange d3 > a4 + italian transposition + falkbeer d3 Bc4 Nf3, pseudo-italian - 46
max lange d3 > 2 a4's + falkbeer d3 Bc4 Nf3, pseudo-italian - 44
max lange d3 > 2 a4's + falkbeer vienna transposition - 43
max lange immediate a4 + falkbeer d3 Bc4 a4 - 41
max lange vienna transposition + falkbeer d3 Bc4 f4 - 34
max lange immediate a4 + falkbeer vienna transposition - 28

but not all of these combos really are efficient. 

________________

so let's compare our vienna lines vs. our bishops opening lines: 

vienna falkbeer g3 + vienna max lange italian - 76
    it's just the pinultimate set of lines in e4/e5 for you. 
    black can easily go wrong in these lines and if he does you're able to punish him. 
    you will often get early advantages in these lines when black just doesn't play it right. 
    the bishop retreat lines aren't really compromising your position, they're just throwing off black. 
    you're winning the theoretical battle by doing this. 

bishops opening max lange d3 > 2 a4's + bishops opening falkbeer d3 Bc4 a4 - 20
    it's also a very good position for you, however black is going to have more chances in these lines. 
    you still have an advantage but you're going to need more theory here. 
    however it's a very good position, don't get me wrong. 
    and it can lead to some quite chaotic variations too. 
    it's also nice because it preserves your bishop. 
    it's really a way of playing an italian that falls completely outside the scope of players theory. 
    there will be some similar ideas, however when things get sharp there may not be complete overlap. 
    final thoughts are this is another fantastic variation, and don't get me wrong you can play this if you enjoy it. 

fun factor score: 
vienna falkbeer g3 + vienna max lange italian - 71
bishops opening max lange d3 > 2 a4's + bishops opening falkbeer d3 Bc4 a4 - 28 

So I guess the exact repertoire I'd already chosen is what prevails. Guess I'm really onto something then. 
But at least now I have an idea of what italian-style game I want to play if I ever am inclined toward that. 

regarding the bishop retreat variation: you're playing moves that aren't permanently compromising your position in any way really. 
given enough time they're all going to transpose into typical italian moves. 
so there's not a structural problem. It can transpose into the most completely serious and viable italian style position you will find. 
it's technically an equal position, but to realize that equality black has to play sharp in a way that's not going to happen. 



===================================================================================================
===================================================================================================
WHITE VS. FRENCH 
===================================================================================================
===================================================================================================

1) chigorin (2. Qe2) - it's a positional game not alot of people will know, and you're good at positional games. 
you're getting a positional theoretical edge by playing this. it could be one of your solid lines. 

2) paulsen w/ burn & others - this is your bread-and-butter line. it's a line you've played in the past and can continue to keep playing. 
there's nothing really broken about it, it's working fine. 
it should be your main defense. 
the only issue with it is it's a theoretically known. 
it plays very naturally though. 
you may feel a little forced to follow lines that are known. 
but at the end of the day it is your main defense, because it's fine and there are subtleties to it you can study. 

3) tarrasch, open, euwe (4. Nf3) - it's another maneuvering theoretical positional line, but you have to remember these lines go very deep. 
it can result in good attacking positions. but it's still based on solid positional principles. 
it would be a good variation for you to learn if you wanted to try something new. 
it's just going to be alot of theory, so you'll have to be ready for that. 

4) la bourdonnais variation (2. f4) - you could learn it. It's a little different than the variation you're playing, but you do run into it on occasion. 
it's a unique setup and you can use your knowledge from the sicilian while playing it and vice versa. 
probably a good way to master defending the mcdonnell attack. 
it's not going to be your main line but it's still a very viable and interesting line. 
it's something you should learn for your general education and as an offbeat weapon you can use to throw people off in a tournament setting. 
can transpose to the pelikan variation or you can avoid it for a slightly less sound position. 

5) reti-spielmann attack (2. g3) - it's actually a variation that you will quite like. 
this will be kind of a sharp line where if the opponent doesn't know it you'll do well, but if they do know it you'll have some issues. 
it's definitely something you could learn, though you'll need to put alot of effort in learning theory to make it really viable. 

6) 2. b3 (horwitz attack) - you could benefit from learning this line. it's a very good way to get your opponent out of theory. 
overall I think you'll do very well with this setup.
you can often launch a strong attack on the kingside, it could be a go-to attacking weapon you use against the french.

7) paulsen w/ steinitz - it's a very good line, it should be one of your lines. for you it could be a go-to staple line. 
there may be ways of mixing it up deeper in the lines, so bear that in mind. 
I don't think it'll be your main defense but it's definitely high on the options list. 

8) diemer-duhm gambit - sharp variation that's objectively slightly better for black, however it really does put him under alot of pressure. 
overall black is often very confused in how to proceed and torn against different priorities. 
it's a gambit line, you could probably use it in bullet to throw people off. 

9) pelikan variation (2. Nc3 > 3. f4) - the issue here is it's a setup that you really don't play. it's a great position. 
you're often going to get complex whole-board positions from this.
it's just a very nice position really. 
you've never learned these lines but if you wanted to learned them as an alternative to what you're doing it'd be a great candidate for that. 

______________________



KIA (2. d3) - the issue is you're conceding the initiative too quickly, you'd rather have more momentum in the middlegame. 
it is advantageous in the sense that it's offbeat compared with what a french player often faces. 
black needs to know how to handle it to get a good position. 
but ultimately there are other variations that are much more sharp than this.

exchange variation, monte carlo - this is a cool line. this line, if you studied it deeply... even though it's not objectively good, it's underestimated. 
you get a good space advantage and you're able to parlay that into some attacks. 
the problem with it though is it can still be drawish, as french exchange lines can be. 
to draw black needs to know the precise moves but there will be black players who know these lines. 

exchange variation w/ Nc3 - so this would be your variation in the exchange if you were going to play the exchange. 
you can transpose into it from other places, other lines you play. 
however, it's not objectively your ideal continuation. it's just not really your style to play this kind of a game. 
you're at a theoretical disadvantage in the exchange and it's difficult to ignore that. 

advanced variation, main line - it's an opening that's a little more grindy, but it's not really objectively as good as the other lines. 
it's also pretty well known, so... it's just a very typical pawn structure and a very typical game. 

advanced, nimzowitsch system (4. Nf3) - kind of an offbeat but not entirely sound attack. it does help to open up the board and open up lines. 
you get a kingside attack but at the end of the day it's an equal position that black can hold. 

advanced, nimzowitsch attack (4. Qg4) - very good way of mixing up the game in the advanced french, people will usually not know the line. 
however black has ways of dealing with it if he plays carefully. 
ultimately it's just not objectively good, unfortunately. 

advanced, steinitz variation (4. dxc5) - again the whole point of it is to be offbeat. 
at the end of the day I wouldn't recommend this since black can just deal with it. 

tarrasch, open, suchting (4. c3) - it's not so appealing, it's kind of like a worse version of the burn variation really, would rather just play that. 

tarrasch, open, main line  (4. exd5) - don't play this, too many people know the theory and it's just going to be way too played out. 

tarrasch, open, 4. Bd3 rare move - it's another line you just to avoid, 
it's kind of a desperate attempt to throw off the opponent but the opponents position is solid. 

steiner variation, double exchange - I wouldn't underestimate this as an option, it's actually a good option. 
there are some attacking lines because you're opening up the board early. 
there are some odd and strange moves that have to be played. 
however at the end of the day it's not truly sound so keep that in mind. 

steiner, Orthoschnapp (4.Qb3) - it looks like just a bad version of the steiner. 

kings knight, advanced (2. Nf3 > 3. e5) - the isue with this line is there's nothing really that special about. 

two knights - it leads to a precise series of moves, and it can do well unless your opponent knows the moves. 
but if they know the moves it's just a worse version of other french lines for all intents and purposes. your knight ends up misplaced basically. 
so you're basically counting on your opponent not knowing the theory, or you knowing the theory more deeply than them.

steinitz attack (2. e5) - this is actually a very offbeat way of screwing people up. they need to know the specific continuation to respond. 
but ultimately you'd be much better off playing other variations.

2. c3 - I wouldn't really recommend this line. it's just not the right time to play c3 yet. 


===================================================================================================
===================================================================================================
WHITE VS. KID 
===================================================================================================
===================================================================================================

* samisch (5. f3) - if you wanted a defense to call your own defense this would be the one. it's just a very good and solid position 
which is similar to the sicilian dragon Yugoslav setup. It could just be your defense and it'd be perfectly fine, no issues. 
It's very much a defense that belongs to you in terms of the openings you typically play and how the different ideas here mesh 
with those other openings. It often leads to precise games where black has to play very sharply, fischer actually avoided it which 
says alot. So looking good for the samisch 

* 5. Nf3 > 6. h3 - it's a strong sideline, it'll throw people off, and it's still sound. if black doesn't respond precisely though 
he'll be at a disadvantage. however it can be a little bit boring because it's a little slow 

* move 3 sideline - 3. h4 - the KID can be very theoretical, but this is a very effective way of throwing off peoples theory, so it's 
interesting as far as that goes. you need to know a precise followup if they play correctly, but you can learn that. But you're going 
to expand on the kingside eventually with how you play this anyway, you'll just have to figure out how to make that all work. 

* fiancetto variation (3. Nf3 / 4. g3) - it's a more positional game, you're not going to be occupying the center and defending from 
a kingside attack the same way you usually do. But you'll still have a positional advantage over black, you'll just have to play sharply 
and capitalize on it. It's a solid setup. 

* 5. Bd3 - this can transpose to some positions that resemble the sicilian dragon, but it's a tricky move order and you have to deal with 
those tricky move order issues early to reach that position. But if they play it correctly it can become more equalized than your other positions. 
At that point it becomes kind of a slog. 

move 3 sideline - 3. f3 - 

move 4 sideline - 4. Nf3 - 

move 4 sideline - 4. Bf4 - 

Larsen variation (5. Nf3 > 6. Be3) -

orthodox variation (5. Nf3 > 6. Be2) -

zinnowitz variation (5. Nf3 > 6. Bg5) -

semi-averbakh system (5. Be2 > 6. Be3) -

averbakh variation (5. Be2 > 6. Bg5) -

four pawns attack (5. f4) -

makogonov variation (5. h3) -

Kramer variation - 5. Ne2 - 

accelerated averbakh - 5. Bg5 - 

deferred fiancetto - 5. g3 -

WHITE VS. SICILIAN 
===================================================================================================
===================================================================================================

ideas from kramniks videos: 

2. b3
2... Nc6 3. Nc3 
2... e6 3. g3 
2... e6 3. Nc3 
2... e6 3. b3 


2ND MOVE OPTIONS:

1) morphy gambit: this is a very tricky variation that will take people off guard. black will make mistakes that they wouldn't otherwise make here. 
it'll require learning and you don't have to play it immediately, but as a long term goal it's a cool idea. 

2) open sicilian: it's a pretty easy choice to play this. it's alot of theory, that is one thing... but it's just a good position. 
positions here are very sharp and very theoretical. 

3) wing gambit (2. b4): this is quite effective in throwing people off, so it can be good for that, however it's not an objectively sound opening. 

closed sicilian: it's just a more equal position where you're trying to throw the opponent off 
but the reality is it doesn't throw people off as much as some people think it does

snyder variation (b3): it's not truly good, that's the issue with it. 

mengarini (2. a3): it's just a very risky line where you can get good positions but you can also get crushed. 

2. d3: it's just going to lead to a very formulatic position which you don't like 


__________________________
OPEN SICILIAN - 3RD MOVES: 

__________________________
VS. E6: 

westerenin attack - it's a very offbeat and rare positional opening that's quite sound and too quickly dismissed. 
it's an opening you wish you played because it's going to be quite effective. 
again lots of interesting traps in these lines, and black has to play very precisely to do well. 

main line - it's something you want to play even though it's probably wiser for you not to play it. 
the reason is it's very theoretical, and you don't really have enough time to learn all this theory. 
you can expect your opponent to mirror you move for move, and you're really going to be struggling to match him.

closed - don't play this, e6 is the best line against the closed. 

wing gambit deferred - another completely viable way of bringing the pressure early. 
of course it's not really sound like all these wing gambits, but it's still something you can play and succeed with. 

__________________________
VS. NC6: 

1) main line - you're apprehensive playing it for now, but it's a variation that you can learn in time, it's not unlearnable. 
it's very theoretical and very tactical. but as you learn the lines you're going to like them more. 

2) wing gambit - it's a strong variation. it'll allow you to avoid a big chunk of theory, especially if you combine it with other anti-sicilians. 
you do get a strong center but you'll be down a pawn so it's a little dubious. but if you really want to throw someone off it's a great way to do it. 

3) closed - this is a good line, it does allow you to avoid the sveshnikov / kalashnikov. you will have to learn that e5 variation though.

rossolimo - it's a very strong line though it's probably not your preferred one. 
it's kind of a grindy attacking opening, it's not the kind of position you'd typically play although it is good.

__________________________

Repertoire Ideas: 

options vs. Nc6 / d6 / e6: 
a - rossolimo + moscow + westerenin: 
    so the problem with this is there's alot of theory to it. both the rossolimo and the moscow grow in size quickly 
b - closed + moscow + westerenin 
    so it's not bad because it allows you to avoid theoretical positions. but it's also just slightly suboptimal with the moscow. 
c - closed + open + westerenin 
    it's one of your top combos for sure. you could maybe look for a slight variation to it, but it's really up there. 
    it's going to be your more theoretical way of playing. 
d - closed + open + open 
    this is you fighting for a theoretical advantage. it's taking the theoretical advantage idea a step further. 
e - open + open + westerenin 
    so compared with the closed vs Nc6 this is a more attacking alternative. and you can think of the westerenin as an attacking move as well. 
    it's testing the opponent. not necessarily about being efficient in terms of the theory, since black can transpose into the french from Nc6. 
f - open + open + open 
    so there's alot of theory here, it's a very classical setup. they're good positions, you do have an advantage, but they are very well known lines. 
g - portsmouth + wing attack + wing attack 
    it would be cool to learn these lines just so you could improve your own play against the wing attacks 
h - portsmouth + open + westerenin 
    I wouldn't recommend this except for tricks. It can get you wins, but it's also not the best objectively. 
i - rossolimo + open + westerenin 
    don't even bother with this 
j - closed sicilian Nf3 - grand prix - open transposition 
    it's a cool little way of playing but it's not really your style 

So the serious options seem to be... 
1) closed + open + westerenin  
2) closed + open + open 
3) open + open + westerenin 
4) open + open + open 

let's do one more focused comparison of just these 4 then: 

a - closed + open + westerenin - 30 
    you'll often get a good theoretical advantage here 
b - closed + open + open - 64 
    so there are alot of moves and countermoves you need to know to play the french sicilian. 
    if you were to play it as black then it'd make more sense to do this, but if not it wouldn't make as much sense. 
c - open + open + westerenin - 11
    so you're going to get a very good attacking game here. it's not going to be drawish, contrary to what you sometimes get in the closed lines. 
d - open + open + open 
    so I wouldn't really recommend going with this one. you don't need to do this. 
__________________________ 

So it seems to me the critical choice is between playing the westerenin or playing the open french sicilian. 
We can stick with the closed and forget about the sveshnikov / lowenthall. 
But the deciding factor will be whether we're playing the french sicilian ourselves. 
So eventually... we'll go with b. But for now we'll go with a. 
And maybe we can play both, since the westerenin is a very cool line anyway. 
But what this does mean is we'll need to learn the four knights exchange rather than transposing it into the sveshnikov. 

===================================================================================================
===================================================================================================
WHITE VS. SCANDINAVIAN 
===================================================================================================
===================================================================================================

closed scandinavian - you'll usually get a good position because they don't know the theory, that's the bottom line. 
but there is the particular issue where if they know specific lines you may have problems. 
but for the most part it's going to be an ideal position for you. 
the particular line is troublesome though so it's kind of a mix bag

2. d3 dxe4 3. dxe4 (queen trade line) - it's an equal position but it's a good way of avoiding theory, so worth considering. 
I wouldn't underestimate this opening, if you really learned it it'd be quite good. 
It'd be a very unique line that alot of people do not play. 

2. d3 dxe4 3. Nc3 (dunst-perennet gambit) - you get good initiative through the midgame here.
also a good offbeat line though not quite as good as the queen trade line. 

blackmar-diemer transposition - if you want a complicated game that will really throw the opponent for a loop this is a good line to play. 
it's quite good but it's not your ideal line still. 

2. exd5 Qxd5 3. Nc3, main line - it is the ideal line here, you can get some strong attacks, the only issue is it's theoretical. 
there are a few lines where you have to defend the kingside and be careful about your king, but if you know the theory you'll be fine. 
you also have to watch for the d file opening up in some lines. 
but overall it's the best variation for you to play. 

2. exd5 Qxd5 3. Nf3 - it's offbeat a little, but not that offbeat... issue is it leads to kind of a boxed in sort of position. not a grindy game but just boxed in. 

________

QA5 LINE:

1) 4. Bc4 Nf6 5. d3 - it's a great position for you, more of an italian style game in terms of the patterns, and it's dynamic. 
the only issue is it's pretty theoretical for black and you'll need to find a way to throw him off from that. 
look for the lines where you gambit or sac material. this is the line I want to go for, it's just alot of fun. 

2) 4. d4 Nf6 5. Bc4 - this is nice, it's kind of sharp and forcing and you can memorize it, so you don't need to spend too much time. 
the only issue with it is it can require a precise sequence of moves on the kingside in certain lines. 
but it doesn't look like black has anything in those lines, it kind of looks like it's going to lead to a very good position for you, so I wouldn't worry about it. 

3) 4. g3 - a good offbeat weapon, it's not as sound as the other lines but it will get people out of theory. 

4) 4. d4 Nf6 5. Nf3 - the thing is this will be blacks bread-and-butter lines, and even though they're objectively fine black will beat you in these lines because they'll know them so well. 

___________

leonhardt gambit (4. b4) - it you wanted to play like this it'd be better just to play the blackmar-diemer, it's just better. 

4. Nf3 Nf6 5. Bc4 - I wouldn't want to play this as white, you kind of get boxed in on the kingside, the knight gets pinned. 

4. Nf3 Nf6 5. g3 - there's really no reason to play this, this is just giving yourself problems for no reason. 

4. Bc4 Nf6 5. Nge2 - again a pin can neutralize you, I like it more than the Nf6 line but I still don't like it. 

4. d4 Nf6 5. Bd2 - it's just not good, it kind of fizzles out too quickly, and the resulting positions are slow and lacking in tempo 

===================================================================================================
===================================================================================================
BLACK VS. ALAPIN SICILIAN 
===================================================================================================
===================================================================================================

e6 - kind of a grindy game but it'll transpose into positions you can learn independently from the alapin, like the advanced French, the lone e pawn French. but the plans are kind of straightforward and easy in this variation 

Nf6 - it's a good position too it's just kind of algorithmic and you're interested in getting away from the opponents algorithm. the opponent might have some advantage in terms of knowing the position so well because he plays it frequently and you don't play it as much 

d5 - if you play the barmen it's really kind of risky because you're giving that pawn early and you don't always reclaim it. if you play the Qxd5 line it's alright, it's not a bad line but you do need to know a very specific move order with the queen, and it feels like you're restricted and on the back foot.

e5 - it's a rare line that does challenge white in a way few lines in the alapin do, and leads to a sharp position. the only issue is it can lead to trades in the center and your pawns can feel overextended. It's objectively fine and you can succeed but you have to know the lines and it's just harder to play. white can also trade down and get a reasonable position without too much effort

g6 - it'd be a good system if there wasn't a specific line that gives it trouble 

Nc6 - can be difficult to play this 



===================================================================================================
===================================================================================================
WHITE VS. SEMI-SLAV
===================================================================================================
===================================================================================================

1) 75/100 - breyer variation - it's a good way of avoiding alot of theory. if your opponent handles it right he'll do okay, but you'll do well if he doesn't handle it right. it could be one of your go-to defenses if that's the direction you want to go. it's kind of algorithmic, but the patterns are funky - it's sort of a funky knight move, and the opponent has to move his bishop around in certain ways, and the queens may come out... so there are weird, funky patterns. if you want to play a fun, simple line where you get good attacks and it's solid it's a good choice and could be your main line. 
I think I'll go with this one, it looks more fun and unusual than the russian variation. 

2) 67/100 - russian variation - this leads to quite a strong attack, it's a very good attacking setup. it's another very solid option, alot of players have trouble dealing with this. the only issue with it is it's not objectively the ideal way to play. but again it's kind of a strange move that bypasses theory. of course it does have its own theory, and you could study this deeply itself, so it's more accurate to say it bypasses the rest of the semi-slav theory. think of it kind of like the trompowsky, it bypasses things. 
this variation could almost be the best choice for you because it avoids theory but it's also a little more fundamentally sound of a position than the breyer. 

3) 61/100 - main meran lines (Nf3 / Nc3 / e3) - it's very theoretical but it also leads to a strong attack. you'll have to study the theory, but there are also ways of getting your opponent out of theory. I think if you know these lines you'll do well. It kind of throws black into such chaos that he's not going to be able to handle it. 

________________________

three knights setup (Nf3 / Nc3) - it's more theory, that's the main issue with this setup. But if you know the theory it's good for you. 

slav exchange (3. dxc5) - so even though it's kind of an equal position it's much easier for you to play, it's going to be a grindy game and you'll have the tempo. there are certain variations that are very good, where you can spice things up and make the game very interesting. however I don't think it's the ideal move for you. 

quiet variation w/ Nf3 - it still ends up being alot of theory actually. it's just a little less potent, you're kind of boxed in a little bit more. 

quiet variation w/ Nc3 - it's an overrated variation, I would skip it 

main Bg5 lines (Nf3 / Nc3 / Bg5) - it's not exactly a position you're going to enjoy playing, the queen comes out and you're going to have to know alot of theory. even though you're objectively sound it's just too much theory for you to deal with. 

5. Qd3 - I believe this transposes with some other line. it's a sharp line but if they know the line it's not really objectively great. it's unlikely they're going to know all that theory though. so if you really studied it you could make a game out of it, and it's still equal. but it's just theory you don't really want to have to learn, it's not inspiring to learn, you'd rather put your efforts into something else better. 

5. Qa5 - 

5. Qb3 - 

early fiancetto setup (Nf3 / g3) - I would not recommend this, it's not that good. 

delayed fiancetto (Nf3 / Nc3 / g3) - 

5. Bf4 - 

3. Nc3 > 4. f3 - 

move 5 slav exchange (Nf3 / Nc3 / dxc5) - 

move 4 slav exchange (either Nf3 or Nc3 + dxc5) -


===================================================================================================
===================================================================================================
WHITE MISC 
===================================================================================================
===================================================================================================

QGD exchange vs. modern: 

exchange - it's a good position fundamentally, it's based on solid positional principles. However it is very theoretical so you will need to study deeply to do well in it. But if you know the theory you're going to have very solid pawn pushes that give you great attacks. Especially the lines where you end up pushing the f pawn. The only thing you have to watch out for is a player who knows the theory so well they can equalize anyway. In this case you'll just have to memorize a precise sequence of moves and respond correctly. you're basically trying to out-theorize the opponent. the game is also very positional, so you will enjoy that aspect of it. 

modern - you'll have alot more opportunities to get your opponent out of theory this way. it'll actually perform very well when you find these lines to escape theory. the position will not be quite as sound as the exchange though, so that's a compromise. the other issue is you'll have to face the tartakower which is a good line for black, very theoretical and you'll need to study it in alot of depth. one nice thing about this opening is it can be transposed into from the trompowsky, so if you're playing that line the value of this one goes up. the theoretical variations are ones you can learn though, don't believe you can't learn them. And there will be ways of getting your opponent out of theory. 

for my repertoire where I'm not playing the tromp the ideal choice will still be the modern. Why? Because you can get your opponent out of theory that way, very simple. otherwise you just end up in a very theoretical position way deep, and even though it's a good position as you climb this is just not something you want to do. 

______________________

and if you're playing the modern you should also play the anti-nimzo move order apparently. 
for deciding whether to transpose to the exchange from the anti-nimzo the critical question is does it allow you to avoid semi-slav theory apparently

===================================================================================================
===================================================================================================
BLACK SICILIAN OPTIONS 
===================================================================================================
===================================================================================================


1) Taimanov/Kan hybrid (Nc6 > a6) - avoids the annoying maroczy bind line against the kan. Can lead to completely chaotic positions. 
If white doesn't take the knight, the best move, but plays something like Bd3, black usually does very well. And this is most often what happens. 
If they do take the knight you have a solid pawn structure and you can push d5. but this isn't easy equality if white plays it right. 
this leads to whole board positions, and the lines are more theoretical. Generally these lines are not very well known below high elo. 
Objective eval is about on par with the french defense... amongst the sicilians that are good objectively this one is probably the least common, 
recommended if you want to steer the game into your territory without really compromising anything.

2) Accelerated Dragon - much more legit than the hyperaccelerated dragon, it's a completely viable alternative to the dragon. 
some variations can get pretty messy, however black is still okay in all of them. most importantly it allows you to avoid the yugoslav. 
you can push d5 in one move in many cases and you can just get a good position. 
biggest downside is you must face the anti-sicilians of old sicilian, i.e. rossolimo / closed sicilian w/ Nc6

3) Four Knights - can be a very attacking sicilian. you bring both knights out quickly and you also open up the kings bishop... 
so you can often push d5 with tempo after pinning whites knight on c3. This sicilian will usually land you an ideal equal position when players 
don't play the 2 main moves, which happens often. But against Ndb5 you can be forced to either go into a sveshnikov or to play a suboptimal line. 
However the four knights can also be a way of reaching the sveshnikov while avoiding the rossolimo. Then with the immediate Nxc6, 
probably the most challenging line, you get a position that's actually pretty dynamic / messy, objectively it's on par with the Rossolimo 
but I think you'll have a better experience advantage here, and the position quite interesting. 
If I were going to play the Sveshnikov I'd probably reach it via the Four knights

4) Classical - a somewhat offbeat sicilian that's also sound and generally very underestimated. 
if white doesn't play the main line rauzer you often just get an ideal setup... your setup is very aggressive due to the knight on c6. 
in the richter-rauzer lines, even though your pawn structure may be compromised or you may be down a pawn (depending on the line you choose), 
you still have significant counterplay. you can also just study the richter-rauzer itself very deeply because 
that's the only line you have to worry very much about. but in most of the classical lines it's just going to be easy equality. 
in most lines you just get the perfect attacking sicilian setup.

5) Taimanov bastrikov - if you want to throw off the opponent and get out of theory this is a very good way to do it. 
Not only is it an offbeat sicilian but it also brings the queen out, and the variations increase in size complexity very quickly as a result. 
the only thing about it is your queen can get backed up in some lines and that's kind of uncomfortable. 
you have to make sure the queen doesn't get trapped, and in some lines you even trade the queen for 3 pieces, 
resulting in a crazy position. overall it can be tough if white really knows what he's doing, but that's very rare. 
Generally a good option for a club player or as an off weapon.

6) Lowenthall - another very attacking sicilian, more tactical than others. 
The lines are also pretty forcing. it's not as objectively sound as the sveshnikov but it's a little more offbeat. 
but it can also transpose into the sveshnikov with a little extra effort. 
but otherwise, just playing the lowenthall, it's a way of minimizing the theory you need to learn while still getting a nice tactical sicilian.

7) Nimzowitsch - people act as if there's a very hard counter in main line, but this actually isn't true... 
the main line can be played reliably if you study the line deeply, it's even objectively better than the yugoslav. 
This can be a good off weapon, maybe not a main weapon but especially in online play, when it isn't expected, 
the opponent often has no idea how to handle these strange knight maneuvers, and you often just get an edge in the opening as a result. 
I generally think of this as an improved alekhines, many of the positions have a hypermodern tone to them. One of the biggest 
selling points of this sicilian is it avoids most anti-sicilians, since it begins on move 2.

8) Najdorf - so it's very theoretical, and commonly played sicilian. It's also a more defensive and positional sicilian, a6 is not an attacking move, 
it's a theoretical move that keeps the balance and refrains from committing to a setup. This is going to be the most equal and objectively sound 
sicilian. there are alot of different variations you have to learn with this, like 10 or so, and they're all pretty theoretical. 
but if you learn the vast amount of theory it's quite good. there are many attacks white can launch but at the same time there's always 
a way of holding off the attack.

9) Scheveningen - this is a very underplayed line. people assume the g5 pawn advance can't be dealt with but if you study it you're capable of hanging 
on. Almost no one actually knows the theory here. you do have to know precise theory not only for the keres but for the English 
setup which also requires careful navigating. however if you know the theory you will hang on and you can achieve equality in practice. 
there are also going to be some attacking opportunities, because this is a sicilian that focuses on development. 
Note that there are actually two ways of reaching the Schveneningen - via the french sicilian or via the modern (d6). 
The french sicilian is more played, here you can delay Nf6 a bit and play Nc6 first, this deals a little better with the Keres. 
I wouldn't write the Scheveningen off but I probably wouldn't use it in a tournament setting as a main weapon, in online play it's very viable.

10) Dragon - in this line you'll often find the kingside comes under attack. 
While the yugoslav doesn't appear to be objectively very good for black, the dragon is not refuted by any means, 
and infact black is scoring well in the yugoslav. 
Probably because the yugoslav is the only really challenging line for the dragon, so black can just focus very heavily 
on learning the theory and out theorize the opponent. It's similar to the classical in this respect. 
And this makes it very practical for online play / for the club player. For white to maintain the engine edge in the yugoslav 
it's a very long sequence of moves, black can just play this until the opponents knowledge of theory is depleted. 
And once you can deal with the yugoslav attack everything else is quite easy to deal with for the dragon. 
The bishop on g7 is more active than on e7, most other lines are a breeze to deal with.

11) Sveshnikov - very tactical, attacking sicilian. It's a completely crazy attack, but it's also very theoretical. 
Here the effort is really to try to out-theorize the opponent in these sharp tactical lines. 
Allows black to play a very attacking style of chess. However you have to tolerate some very dubious positions especially with your king exposed.
Overall it's alot of theory and it puts alot of burden on the opponent to know all that theory. A good option for players who like this kind of line.

12) Hyperaccelerated Dragon - your goal is generally to transpose into the dragon through another move order while avoiding the yugoslav. this line 
is a little dubious and often requires you to play very sharply to hang on. that said if black knows the lines very well he can hang on. 
but overall it's an unusual offbeat opening which transposes back into a mainline opening while avoiding most anti-sicilians. 
basically you end up needing both theory from the dragon and all this sharp theory for the hyperaccelerated dragon, but you avoid many anti-sicilians.
By comparison, the accelerated dragon has to tolerate some difficult anti-sicilians (rossolimo), 
and the dragon has to face the yugoslav, so it's a tradeoff. But maybe the rossolimo is the least bothersome of all the lines

13) Kan - some of the lines against the kan are quite sharp on black, and you have to know the theory well. but if you know the theory well, 
with the right maneuvers, you can fight for equality. what you'll get out of it is a very theoretical sicilian that's not very common, 
so it puts pressure on white to know his theory.

___________________________

apparently my ideal final repertoire will consist of 3 sicilians: 
taimanov bastrikov + four knights + classical sicilian 
all of these can be reached via the old sicilian. 
infact... all 5 of my top 5 lines can be reached via the old sicilian.
but the dice suggest otherwise...
old sicilian - 21 
d6 - 30 
e6 - 46 

comparing the 5 lines: 
taimanov kan hybrid - you get very easy and very good aggression in this line. your bishop can open up at some point. 
accelerated dragon - it's a fiancetto position that's very hard to crack 
taimanov bastrikov - if you know the lines it's very hard for white to get anything done
four knights - you can sidestep alot of theory and in most cases just get an advantage 
classical - like the taimanov kan hybrid you can get very good aggression here too, but you're not really sacrificing anything to get it. 

___________________________

so it seems to me that it's between the taimanov kan hybrid and the classical. let's do one more comparison
taimanov kan hybrid - so this is a very offbeat line, an offbeat way of attacking. however it doesn't stick to chess principles quite the same way. 
classical - this opening is less offbeat and more classical in terms of the principles it adheres to. 
however when the attack does begin in these lines the attack is quite vicious. 
the classical wins. the reason is it's such a complex dynamic position you'll be able to study in alot of depth, 
and you'll do very well in these positions. 

So it really seems to me that the classical is winning this one. 
Yet again I chose the right lines. 

apparently if you're looking for an off-weapon to use alongside the classical sicilian the best 3 are: 
1) lowenthal 
2) nimzowitsch
3) scheveningen 

I can use the nimzowitsch / scheveningen without dramatically altering my move order so I'll probably just go with those. 
maybe one day in the distant future I can test out some of the french sicilians, but for now I'm just sticking with the classical / scheveningen.
