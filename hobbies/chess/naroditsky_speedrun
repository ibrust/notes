- when up material trading capitalizes on a long term material advantage 
  but sometimes avoiding the trade is better if your pieces have more immediate decisive value 

- if you think about it the best way of chasing a piece out of a square is with a pawn 
  it guarantees the piece will never return to the square... it also gains tempo 

- part of the logic for opening up your kindside is a judgement call that 
  a) you have more pieces on the kingside 
  b) your attack is fast enough 

- when you develop think about ways to prevent the opponents development

- it's important to evaluate the value of pieces correctly. 
  look at how many squares the piece controls, what it's doing and what its potential is
  although there are occasionally times when pieces are terrible, but when it opens up it will be very good. keep that in mind - you want to think in the long run too 

- in the opening he considers carefully whether to close or open the center.
  he bases this decision at least in part on comparing his development with his opponents 
  he points out that when you're ahead in development you want to open the center to most capitalize on that 
  on the flipside if you're a bit behind in development closing the center is a good thing for you 

  but generally you should maintain the tension unless there's a clear reason to open or close the center, 
    you dont always want to resolve the tension too early 

  in another example the opponent plays h6 in an e4 opening and he opens the center instinctively 

  later on, in an endgame, he gets in a position where his pieces are more active and he also opens it up for that reason. 
  when your pieces are more active and the position is open they can exert themselves more and maximize their advantage 

  but at another time... he closed the center because he was attacking on the kingside. so that makes sense 

- while playing these e4 opening positions he often applies logic focusing very heavily on the speed of development 

- he talks about how you can transform one type of advantage into another, and how this is important to do at various moments. 
  at one point he had a pawn advantage, but he sacrificed it to gain initiative, he didn't hold onto the pawn. he transformed his advantage

- he talks about how, when playing against an IQP, you often want to trade down the pieces
  likewise if you have an IQP you want to keep the pieces on 
  also talks about the importance of blockading the IQP vs pushing it forward 
  but this is a bit of an oversimplification, there are alot of intricacies to IQP positions

- he's very aware of potential outposts 

- his opponent weakened the darksquares around his king, and they traded off their darksquare bishops. 
  at this point he established control over a darksquare outpost with one of his pawns and worked to plant a knight there. 

- he often has a particular logical goal in mind, like an outpost, and the moves then follow in a way that reinforces that plan 

- he mentions a common a phrase "do not rush in the endgame" 

- generally he's very aware of weak squares when forming his plans 
  he also induces weak squares
  when an opponent makes a move he's also very aware of what weaknesses it creates

- in the endgame he says piece activity is very crucial 
  pawns that can become passed pawns are also very important to consider 

- whenever he trades he's very carefully considering how to trade on his own terms
