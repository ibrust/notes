vs 1. e4 

four knights I'm happy with 
but alternatives worth trying are: 
- the other french sicilians, especially the taimanov 
- accelerated dragon (randomly selected)
- moscow attack (canal-sokolsky attack) (randomly selected) 
- O'kelly variation 

but most deadly weapon if used over a lifetime is the four knights, apparently 

some other sicilian variations worth learning just for learing new positions / increasing general skill: 
- O'kelly variation 
- hyper accelerated dragon 
- four knights (already know it)
- pin variation 
- scheveningen 
- svesnikov 
- kan 
- accelerated dragon

vs. 1. d4 

QGA is interesting. I feel like it's boring, but there are a few sidelines that could be worth trying
semi-slav is cool but way too complicated, and the scholtz variation is difficult. I think it's doable but would take a ton of effort 

the modern variation is something I'm getting more interested in. 
    the knight exchange I feel backs you up too much and leads to an advantageous position for white without them having to do much. 
    but the standard variation... although the winrates look bad initially, there are some sidelines where the winrates improve. 
    the way this opening synergizes w/ the vienna also makes it appealing

____________

as white

the four knights spanish... I like its winrate, but I feel it's a little too simple to mirror and the rubinstein variation looks a little dangerous. 
    I also don't feel it's punishing enough. 
    but I still like the winrate. 

the catalan looks interesting, but there's alot involved in getting to it. if I could get to it reliably I'd be happy. 
    maybe it's worth looking at the english...
    I'd also need to learn different kings indian defense / gruenfeld lines.
