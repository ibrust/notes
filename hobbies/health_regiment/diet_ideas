- yogurt will be a staple food 
- eat salad regularly as well
    he adds beans and nuts to his salad 
    maybe olives too 

- have a jar of mixed nuts, as diverse as possible. 
    put it on your salad / in the yogurt 
- try to often get eggs in the morning 

- fermented foods is something I've underestimated. I need to do that. 

- some ideas for grains:  
    quinoa
    barley
    oats
    lentils
    legumes 
    chickpeas
    other beans 

I probably should start cooking & eating beans / legumes. 
    it's a good way to get carbs 
    maybe sweet potato too 

- decaf coffee - if you can find one that followed a good decaffeination process, research that 
    I could even mix decaf + regular, do a half and half 

- maybe diversify my fruit intake somewhat. 
    pears are a good option 
    I like the idea of grapefruit too
