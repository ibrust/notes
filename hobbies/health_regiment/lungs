To get chronic congestion out of your lungs, you can use techniques like controlled coughing and huff coughing, stay hydrated by drinking warm fluids, inhale moist air from a humidifier or steam, practice breathing exercises, and get regular exercise like walking or cycling. For chronic conditions like COPD, consult a healthcare provider for a personalized plan, as more advanced treatments like inhaled medications or chest physical therapy may be necessary.  

At-Home Techniques
Controlled Coughing: Sit with your feet flat on the floor, wrap your arms around your stomach, take a deep breath, and then cough forcefully while pressing your arms against your stomach. 
Huff Coughing: Inhale deeply, then tense your stomach muscles and exhale quickly and forcefully, making a "ha" sound. Repeat this several times. 
Deep Breathing: Inhale slowly to fully expand your lungs, which can help loosen mucus, and then exhale. 
Stay Hydrated: Drinking plenty of fluids, especially warm ones, helps thin mucus, making it easier to cough out of the lungs. 
Inhale Moist Air: Use a humidifier or take a steamy shower to add moisture to the air, which helps to loosen mucus. 
Lifestyle Changes
Regular Exercise: Engage in activities like walking or cycling to improve lung function and reduce phlegm. 
Quit Smoking: If you smoke, quitting is crucial for improving lung health and reducing congestion. 
Healthy Diet: A balanced diet is important for your body's overall ability to fight infections and maintain energy levels. 
Medical Interventions (Consult a Doctor)
Breathing Exercises: A healthcare provider can teach you specific exercises, such as pursed-lip breathing, to strengthen breathing muscles and improve lung capacity. 
Chest Physical Therapy: A therapist can guide you through techniques to help clear mucus from the lungs. 
Inhaled Medications: For certain chronic conditions, your doctor may prescribe treatments like hypertonic saline or inhaled antibiotics to thin mucus or reduce the bacterial load in the airways.

Healthy Habits to Support Lung Function
Quit smoking: This is the most powerful step you can take to allow your lungs to begin their natural healing process. 
Avoid pollutants: Limit exposure to secondhand smoke, air pollution, chemical irritants in the home, and other harmful substances that can damage your lungs. 
Get regular exercise: Physical activity helps improve oxygen circulation and overall lung capacity. 
Eat an antioxidant-rich diet: Foods high in antioxidants, like berries, citrus fruits, and leafy greens, can help reduce inflammation and protect lung tissues. 
Stay hydrated: Drinking plenty of water helps thin mucus, making it easier for your lungs to clear out toxins. 
Practice deep breathing: Exercises like Pranayama can improve lung capacity and efficiency. 
Use steam therapy: Inhaling steam can help loosen mucus and open airways. 
Use air purifiers: An air purifier in your home can help remove irritants and improve indoor air quality. 
What Not to Trust
"Detox" products: There is no scientific evidence to support the claims of products designed to "detox" or cleanse the lungs. 
Herbal concoctions without scientific backing: While some herbal remedies may offer benefits, they are not a substitute for avoiding major lung irritants or for professional medical care. 
When to See a Doctor 
If you have a medical condition like chronic bronchitis or emphysema, or if you're experiencing symptoms of lung disease, it's essential to consult a doctor. A medical professional can provide proper diagnosis and treatment.
