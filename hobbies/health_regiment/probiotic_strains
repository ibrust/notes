3) Lactobacillus plantarum LM2

  dr bergs probiotic has this in it

interesting because in the descriptions these strains mention one another as working in conjunction
"L. plantarum LM2 and L. brevis Y1 produce, respectively, Acetylcholine (Ach) 
  and Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)"

 lactobacillus rhamnosus and reuteri 
    some doctors and researchers are saying these strains are good 

B Infantis - Berg thinks this is very important and often missing, helps autoimmune diseases

coconut cult yogurt has alot of good strains as well. 
  making your own yogurt could be good.

4 strains of probiotics in people who live 100+: 
  1) Odoribacter 35/100 - thought to improve immune system 
  2) Oscillibacter 88/100 - thought to improve blood lipid profile / blood sugars / insulin sensitivity
  3) christensenella 23/100
  4) akkermansia 22/100 - lowers inflammation, improves metabolic health, good for brain and fighting cancer

if you want to build these bacteria in your body your diet can help. 
  pomegranate, dried cranberry, concord grape, chili peppers, black raspberry, chinese black vinegar (grows akkermansia), salsa, resistance starches (day old rice - becomes a resistance starch; roasted potato leftovers), oatmeal

akkermansia is even critical for helping a person respond to chemotherapy in cancer treatment. 

in a healthy gut akkermansia should make up 5% of the intestinal tract apparently

hitta really thinks we should try to increase Clostridium butyricum in the intestines. I may look into that. 
  He claims sweet potato / goat cheese are two good ways of increasing it. 

a researcher is talking about how the gut needs glutamine + butyrate for fuel.
