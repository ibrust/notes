1) Lactobacillus brevis Y1

  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levilactobacillus_brevis

  interestingly it produces phenethylamine - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenethylamine 


2) Lactobacillus paracasei LC18

3) Lactobacillus plantarum LM2
  https://microbiomepost.com/probiotic-strains/lactobacillus-plantarum-lm2/

  dr bergs probiotic has this in it

interesting because in the descriptions these strains mention one another as working in conjunction
"L. plantarum LM2 and L. brevis Y1 produce, respectively, Acetylcholine (Ach) 
  and Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)"

 lactobacillus rhamnosus and reuteri 
    some doctors and researchers are saying these strains are good 

B Infantis - Berg thinks this is very important and often missing, helps autoimmune diseases

  1) prevotella - helps balance blood sugar. 
        eliminates oxylates 
        missing from 70%
  2) akkermansia - helps with producing gut mucosal lining 
          deficiency increases metabolic issue
          40-60% missing 
  3) faecalibacterium - reduces inflammation / counters autoimmune 
        30-50% missing 
  4) ruminococcus - 50-60% missing 
        deficiency means you can't digest certain fibers from plants

the Reuteri doctor in his experiments also supplemented 
  his patients with 2 other strains: 
  bacillus subtilis 
  lactobacillus gasseri 

  he did this in some experimental effort to combat overgrowth of pathogenic microbes, which apparently reuteri controls and its absence has allowed for 

he also said that Lactobacillus casei Shirota is good for sleep

coconut cult yogurt has alot of good strains as well. 
  making your own yogurt could be good.

4 strains of probiotics in people who live 100+: 
  1) Odoribacter 35/100 - thought to improve immune system 
  2) Oscillibacter 88/100 - thought to improve blood lipid profile / blood sugars / insulin sensitivity
  3) christensenella 23/100
  4) akkermansia 22/100 - lowers inflammation, improves metabolic health, good for brain and fighting cancer

if you want to build these bacteria in your body your diet can help. 
  pomegranate, dried cranberry, concord grape, chili peppers, black raspberry, chinese black vinegar (grows akkermansia), salsa, resistance starches (day old rice - becomes a resistance starch; roasted potato leftovers), oatmeal

akkermansia is even critical for helping a person respond to chemotherapy in cancer treatment. 

in a healthy gut akkermansia should make up 5% of the intestinal tract apparently

hitta really thinks we should try to increase Clostridium butyricum in the intestines. I may look into that. 
  He claims sweet potato / goat cheese are two good ways of increasing it. 

a researcher is talking about how the gut needs glutamine + butyrate for fuel.

regarding C15: 
  Several probiotic species, when combined with specific substrates like inulin or galactooligosaccharides (GOS), can produce pentadecanoic acid (C15:0). Specifically, Parabacteroides distasonis uses inulin to produce C15:0. Additionally, a combination of GOS and Limosilactobacillus reuteri can enrich C15:0. Bifidobacterium adolescentis is also known to be a C15:0 producer.
