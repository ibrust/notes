=============================================
WATER 
=============================================

- distilled water can be good if you add sea salt + electrolytes to it. it can help detoxify your body. good to combine with fasting. but don't buy it from the store, make it with a distiller or something like this. 
- berg says his electrolytes don't include sea salt, so you do need to add it (like 1/8th a teaspoon)
- when fasting he recommends 2-3 liters of water a day. you need more water while fasting. 
- it's also good to use his wheatgrass powder in your water while fasting, because you become more acidic and the green powder is more alkaline.

- he recommends 3 water filters (they filter out PFAs): travel berkey gravity, ClearlyFiltered, and zero water.

GUT HEALTH 
===============================================

fiber and butyric acid are essential for gut health, they feed your colon cells apparently 

he has a video on making a super yogurt to kill bad gut bacteria: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZV1oYv5Ddo


===============================================
FOODS
===============================================

- sweet potato 
- salmon 
- salad 
- cod liver (try it)
- sauerkrought (try it)
- homemade yogurt 
- beef / red meat (has glutamine in it, berg says it's a good gut healer)

===============================================
SLEEP
===============================================

- melatonin is maximized when temperature in the room is 65F
- sleeping on a large meal will disrupt your sleep apparently 
    he recommends having your meals earlier. breakfast and lunch but no dinner
- blue light in the evening inhibits melatonin.
    cellphone especially has a stronger blue light 
    you can wear blue light filtering glasses
    get rid of the devices 2 hours before sleeping. start reading. 
- exposre to sunlight during the day helps. the vitamin D from the sun helps normalize cycles 
- you should also be taking vitamin D. it's very important for establishing circadium rhythms 
- cellphones give off electro magnetic fields. these can inhibit your sleep apparently 
    apparently he got a device which detects EMFs and found his wall was emitting a strong one 
- some things that inhibit melatonin are: 
    alcohol 
    caffeine
    nicotine 
    anti-depressants
    high carbs 
    exercise 3 hours before sleeping will inhibit mealtonin 
foods to increase melatonin: 
    tart cherries
        consuming juice before bed works 
        consuming the cherries throughout the day works too 
    kiwis - eating 2 a day will increase seratonin, precursor to melatonin 
    fatty fish such as salmon, tuna, trout 
    keifer - he likes to blend it with berries rich in polyphenols (good for gut)
    sourkraut - the microbes can help you sleep. 
        the cabbage also has tryptophan. 
        it also increases GABA 
        also can help reduce cortisol 
        also has vitamin C which his associated with better sleep 

_________________

on KETO if you're having low carb insomnia: 
    it happens due to high insulin (due to resistance) forcing blood sugar too low, 
        which causes release of adrenalin / cortisol to counter-balance and maintain blood sugars. 
    in time it goes away 
    potassium + magnessium + calcium also help 
    apple cider vinegar before bed can help apparently 
    trying not to eat too much protein also helps 
    vitamin B1 in particular helps racing thoughts 
    limit caffeine 
    also taking ketone salts before bed can help provide you fuel where you don't require blood sugar as much 
    vitamin D is also good. people sleep better if they're in the sun. vitamin D will help sleep 

______________

melatonin comes from seratonin. the microbes in your gut make seratonin. 
    l-tryptophan converts to seratonin > melatonin. 
        you can take l-tryptophan (on an empty stomach) and it'll help you sleep. also helps anxiety. 
    to make l-tryptophan work you also need b6. the conversion relies on b6. 

    do things to improve your gut microbiome as well. 
        take a probiotic. 
        you can also take keifer
        saurkraught is also good 
        he likes salad (apple cider vinegar + arugula sounds good, but be sure the fiber doesnt disturb guts)

    and try not to eat too late (apparently) 


long walks - 45-60 minutes - help sleep 

stretching before bed helps sleep 

sometimes caffeine builds up in your system and your liver can't detoxify it. it can keep you up. 

dice suggest that cooking 4 at a time is the ideal for what I'm doing. we can try that in 2 pans maybe.
