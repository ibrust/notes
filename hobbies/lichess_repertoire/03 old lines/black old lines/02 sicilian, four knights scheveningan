        ----------------
        // you can attack on the kingside w/ f5, the queenside with your pawns there, & in the center at d5 
        // don't discount a kingside pawn storm, especially after the opponent takes exd5 & you have a kingside pawn majority. exd5 is usually bad for white. 
        // but sometimes reinforcing f5 with g6 is appropriate too, apparently. 
        // in these kindside attacks you have good chances of taking the e file w/ the rook 

        // white often wants to occupy d5 with his knight 
        // he'll also need to free up his knight on Na3 here. 

        // black piece placements in a standard setup: 
        // dark square bishop - if the diagonal opens up g5 is a good square for it, controlling e3 
        // light square bishop - e3 to control d5 and aim at the queenside 
        // knight on e7 to pressure d5 
        // queenside rook - b8 to prevent a2-a4 and support blacks minority attack 
        // queen - the lightsquares - d7, b7, f7 (to control the d5 square); in some situations g6 or h5 
        // kings rook - often c8, d8, or f8 depending on the situation; or g8 if the file is open

        // piece exchanges: 
        // the worst exchange for black is the lightsquared bishops, after which it is hard to fight for d5 
        // this can be appropriate if the exchange is on e6, forcing fxe6, and you can get control of d5, though
        // the exchange of knights is mostly good for black, since whites knights are his most dangerous blockading pieces usually 
        // the exchange of blacks lightsquare bishop for whites knight has pros and cons. harder to fight for d5, but takes away a dangerous knight 
        // usually this exchange is favorable when part of a plan for active counterplay 
        // blacks darksquare bishop can get active if the g5 diagonal opens up, though it's still restricted. it helps in defending the king. 
        // exchanging it for a knight is favorable if the knight is powerful but don't do this too quicky, make sure it is appropriate 
        // exchanges of rooks and queens are to be avoided as long as white controls d5, since black has more chances in the middlegame then the endgame 

        8. Bg5 a6

            // this allows black to push f6 and attack e4, and to mount a kingside attack, but this attack should be well prepared. 
            // otherwise white can just push g3 and defend it
