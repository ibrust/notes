CHAPTER 1: 

-a site reliability engineer (SRE) is basically a system engineer with tools to automate the infrastructure 
-devops engineers are really responsible for more than this: they're SREs but are also totally involved in the software development lifecycle, 
    coordinating & solving communication problems that go along with release management, meeting requirements, etc. 
-traditional software dev used to divide teams into: business analysts, developers, system admins, QA engineers. this is a horizontal slice of the company. 
-modern devops consists of combined teams: developers, business analysts, system admins, and QA engineers working together: vertical slicing. 
    also called a cross-functional team
-the automation of devops software also allows some reduction in the number of different roles required for a team. 
    For example, a team might now consist of business analysts, developers, and devops engineers. 
    sometimes the business analysts or devops people assist in development. 
    In some teams, both developer and devops roles are merged into one - so you just have devlop/developers and analysts. 
-automation is especially critical when using microservices, which all have to have their deployments managed separately

-devops does not work without good code coverage and automated testing. testing is especially essential to automated deployment
