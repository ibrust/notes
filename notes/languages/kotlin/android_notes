DEVICE COMPATIBILITY 
--------------------------------------------

many different kinds of devices run android, with a wide range of device configurations
    some devices might not have a compass sensor, for example
    dimensions also vary greatly between devices 

to support different devices you can provide configuration-specific app resources in static files 
    android will then select the correct resource for the current device 
    for example, different XML files for different layouts on different devices 

    another approach is to restrict the types of devices that can install your app 
        devices in the google app store can be restricted based on screen sizes, device features, and version

    you can also disable certain optional features at runtime based on what the device supports
