PyPI, located at https://pypi.python.org, is the official repo for third party python packages
this is where pip downloads packages from 

there's an alternative package installer called Conda that comes with Anaconda python distributions 
Anaconda is a distribution of Python and R programming languages for data science and Machine learning 
    the main advantage of Anaconda is it comes with 100 popular python packages for data science and machine learning initially installed 
you can download anaconda from https://www.anaconda.com/download 
conda uses their own independent repository instead of PyPI, and you won't find as many packages available, but the popular ones are available 
to install a package with conda you type: 
    conda install <package_name>

Pipenv is another option. It's a tool that aims to bring the best of all packaging worlds (bundler, composer, npm, cargo, yarn, etc.) to Python.
    It automatically creates and manages a virtualenv for your projects,
    and it adds/removes packages from your Pipfile as you install/uninstall packages
Pipenv is primarily meant to provide users and developers of applications with an easy method to setup a working environment.
