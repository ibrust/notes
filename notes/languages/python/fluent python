CHAPTER 1 - The Python Data Model
=============================================================

the python interpreter typically calls the special methods __*__ 
    by implementing them you allow your objects to leverage alot of built-in language features

usually you want to avoid calling special methods directly, and call a relevant public function instead 
    i.e. use len(obj) instead of obj.__len__()
    the relevant public functions are often better optimized and provide additional services


__repr__ is used by debuggers / fstrings and should return a string that, if possible, can be used to recreate the object 
__str__ is used by print() and should return a human readable string

calls to __str__, if not implemented, fallback to use __repr__ 
    therefor if the output of __repr__ is readable enough you don't have to implement __str__
