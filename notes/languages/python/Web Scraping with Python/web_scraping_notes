install and import beautifulsoup: 
    $: pip3 install beautifulsoup4 

    from bs4 import BeautifulSoup 

create & use a virtual environment: 
    virtualenv your_environment_name 
    cd your_enironment_name 
    source bin/activate 
    
    pip3 install beautifulsoup 
    
    ... 
    deactivate              <- turns off virtual environment 


BeaitufulSoup can handle XML as well as HTML 

encountering exceptions is very common during scraping, and you must know how to handle them. 

if you try to access a tag and it wasn't there this will throw an AttributeError
likewise when you request a page you must check for an HTTPError or URLError

so it's best to write some higher level functions for these common operations, with error handling built into them
