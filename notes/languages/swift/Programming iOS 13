-a UIView knows how to draw itself into a rectangular area 
-a UIView is also a responder (it's a subclass of UIResponder), and can sense taps / gestures 
-views are part of a view hierarchy. If a parent his hidden, its subviews are hidden. 
    likewise if it is moved, its subviews move, etc. 
-the view hierarchy is also the basis of the responder chain (though not identical to the responder chain)
-views can come from nibs or be created in code 
-the top of the view hierarchy is a window - an instance of UIWindow (or your own subclass of it)
-in iOS 13 iPad can support multiple windows, but all iPhones support only one window at a time 
-the window contains one rootViewController, and its view occupies the entire screen (on iOS). 
    everything goes through the rootViewController & its view - the Window is kept separate
-the rootViewController is the base of the viewController hierarchy. its view occupies the full screen 
    & is at the base of the view hierarchy, just below the window
