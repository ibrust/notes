CHAPTER 1, INTRODUCTION: 

-code written in XCode's playground is not compiled, it's reevaluated from top to bottom 
    when the source changes to allow for better testing/debugging

-the operators === and !== are also part of Swift, & test whether two "instance variables" (or constants) point to the same exact object 
-conditional expressions do not require surrounding ()
-conditional expressions must evaluate to type bool 

-using Swift, in macOS an Int is 8 bytes by default. 
-In IOS you compile the program to target old 32bit Iphones or 64bit Iphones, and Int will be 4 or 8 bytes 
-Int.max & Int.min will tell you what the current max/min value of Int is 
-You can also use the explicit types: Int64, Int32, Int16, Int8, UInt64, UInt32, UInt16, UInt8, Int, UInt
-Swift is strongly typed. You cannot add an Int8 to an Int32, you must typecast a variable: 
    let a: Int32 = 200 
    let b: Int8 = 50 
    let c = a + Int32(b) 

-due to the need for manual type conversion it's often recommended to use Ints unless you have a reason not to (performance?)

-Swift also provides "overflow arithmetic operators". These allow overflow (instead of triggering an error, values wrap around): &+, &-, &*

-There are 3 explicit floating point types: Float, Double, Float80 (80 bit floating point) 
-Double is the default inferred from floating point literals 
-be mindful that while floating point numbers are sometimes slightly imprecise and can cause problems in comparisons, 
    print() may round these numbers 

-the fallthrough keyword causes the switch statement to fall through until it finishes a case without a fallthrough


-Swift's switch allows you to use conditionals in the case statements. also you can bind the test value locally in the case statement:
    switch test_statement{
        case _ where test_statement % 2 == 0:               // _ is a placeholder that can be anything. use _ if you only want the conditional test
            ...
        case var bound_value where bound_value % 3 == 0:    // bind the value to a local variable. 
            bound_value /= 3                                // you would only ever do this if you wanted to alter the tested value within the case 
            ...
    }

-some special syntax is associated with case in the switch statement. 
    the if-case statement allows you to use this improved syntax within a normal if statement
-there is a bizarre use of = instead of == for comparisons, apparently, and commas instead of &&. why they'd do this who knows:

    if case 400...417 = status_code, 500...505 = status_code {
        print("unspecified error")
    }

-there's a syntax for simplifying nested ifs similar to the above:
    if test_condition1 == true, test_condition2 == true {       // the same as nested if statements 
        ... 
    }

-repeat-while has taken the place of do-while:

    var i: Int = 0 
    repeat {
        ...
        i += 1
    } while i < 10

-more swift types: String, Character
-String types consist of multiple Character types 
-Character types are unicode: 
    
    var string1 = "hello!"
    for x: Character in string1.characters {    // .characters is required to access the Character array of a String, apparently 
        print("'\(x)'")                         // why the strange syntax to print the variable? It could be another Swift hangup, who knows - not the author 
    }

    print("\u{1F60E}")                          // unicode character in swift 
    print("\u{0061}\u{0301}")                   // a complex unicode character - this prints just 1 character, it combined the 2 unicode characters, apparently...

    for x in string1.unicodeScalars {           // this allows you to look at each individual unicode character in a String 
        print("\(x.value))                      // This will output UInt32's corresponding to the unicode character's hex code 
    }

-some unicode characters have both a complex and simple form. They evaluate as equal to one another.
-you do not access individual characters in a String using brackets [], you use String's properties and methods.

-Due to using a mix of simple & complex unicode, Swift can't easily randomly access individual character indices, 
    because it doesn't know where they begin.  
-Swift uses a subclassed type String.CharacterView.Index to iterate through & access w/ brackets the individual characters in a string.
-String has a startIndex property which returns an object of type String.CharacterView.Index for the 1st character in the string
-String also has String.index() which takes an input String.CharacterView.Index and an Int offset, and returns an offset String.CharacterView.Index

    let string1 = "hello!"                                                      // this entire design is a complete mess 
    let index_type = string1.startIndex 
    let offset_index_type = string1.index(index_type, offsetBy: 4) 
    let actual_character = string1[offset_index_type]                           // o 

-String.CharacterView.Index types also work with the range operator ... which is used to get slices of a string 

    let range_of_index_types = index_type...offset_index_type 
    let range_of_characters = string1[range_of_index_types]                     // hello

-you can access slices of arrays: 

    let array1 Array<String> = ["string1", "string2", "string3", "string4"] 
    let arraySlice = array1[0...2]

-arrays can be compared with == (they will match if the same elements are in the same order)

-dictionary keys must be hashable. Swift's basic types (String, Int, Float, Double, Bool) are all hashable 
-dictionaries return optional values, even if their values are not optionals:

    var dict1: Dictionary<String, Double> = [:]                     // [:] is an empty dictionary. You could also assign to a filled dictionary 
    var dict2 = Dictionary<String, Double>()
    var dict3: [String:Double] = [:] 
    var dict4 = [String:Double]() 
    var dict5 = ["key1", 12, "key2", 15]                            // this approach uses type inference 
    let dict6 = ["key1", 12, "key2", 15]                            // dictionaries can be immutable as well 

    var size = dict5.count
    let value1 = dict5["key1"]                                      // the return type is Int?, not Int
    
    dict5["key2"] = 17                                              // simple way to change a keys value 
    let old_value: Int? = dict5.updateValue(14, forKey: "key1")     // updateValue() returns an optional of the old value & changes it to a new one
    dict5.updateValue(22, forKey: "key2")                           // you don't have to assign the return value  

    dict5["key3"] = 27                                              // to add a new value just directly set a new key 
    dict5["key4"] = 99

    let deleted_value = dict5.removeValue(forKey: "key3")           // removeValue() also returns an optional 
    dict5.removeValue(forKey: "key4")
    dict5["key2"] = nil                                             // this is another way to delete key/values, apparently                              

    for (key, value) in dict6 {                                     // dictionaries return a tuple when you loop through them 
        print("\(key) | \(value)")                                  
    }
    for key in dict6.keys {                                         // if you only need the key, use the .keys property. same for values  
        print(key)
    }

    let array_of_keys = Array(dict6.keys)                           // the Array constructor can take a dictionaries keys or values 
    let array_of_values = Array(dict6.values) 


-Sets (like dictionaries) are unordered, cannot contain duplicates, and their elements must be hashable 

    var set1 = Set<String>()

    set1.insert("value1") 
    let returned_tuple = set1.insert("value2")          // insert() returns an optional tuple: (inserted: true, memberAfterInsert: "value2") 
    set1.insert("value3")                               // inserted indicates whether the insertion succeeded (false if duplicate? author doesnt say)

    var set2 = Set(["value4", "value5", "value6"])      // alternative initialize syntax - notice the type inference
    var set3: Set = ["value7", "value8", "value9"]

    for element in set2 {
        print(element) 
    }

    let boolean_value = set3.contains("value5")         // contains() returns a boolean indicating whether the set contains the item 

    var combined_set = set2.union(set3)                 // combines the 2 sets 
    var intersected_set = set2.intersection(set3)       // gets common elements of 2 sets 

    var is_disjoint = set2.isDisjoint(with: set3)       // returns true if there are no common elements


-functions support variadic parameters, nested functions, can be first class, and can return multiple values using tuples: 

    func print_words(words: String...){                 // ... allows for zero or more parameters (called variadic parameters) 
        for word in words {                             // always use ... at the end of the argument list 
            print("the word is: \(word)") 
        }
    }
    print_words(words: "cat", "splat", "hat")           // specify variadic parameters in a comma separated list 

    func crazy_number(_ var1: Int, _ var2: Int){
        for x in 1...10 {
            var1 = scramble_number(var1) 
            var2 = scramble_number(var2) 
        }
        return var2 - var1

        func scramble_number(_ var1: Int) -> Int {      // swift supports nested functions 
            var1 = (var1 * (var1 + 13)) - (var1 + 21) 
            var1 = (var1 / (var1 - 13)) + (var1 - 21)
            return var1
        }
    }
    crazy_number(112, 322)

    // multiple values can also be returned in tuples. note the syntax for passing / returning array parameters
    func sort_numbers(_ numbers: [Int]) -> (even_numbers: [Int], odd_numbers: [Int]) {
        var even_numbers = [Int]() 
        var odd_numbers = [Int]() 
        for num in numbers {
            if num % 2 == 0 {
                even_numbers.append(num) 
            } else {
                odd_numbers.append(num) 
            }
        }
        return (even_numbers, odd_numbers)          // note this is a named tuple as defined in the signature 
    }

    // to create first class functions you must specify the "function type" - a type that represents the functions signature: 
    let first_class_function: ([Int] -> ([Int], [Int])) = sort_numbers            // left part is the parameters, right part is the return values 

-functions that return nothing actually have an implied -> Void return type. Void is a 'typealias' for (), apparently. these are all equivalent: 
    func function() { ... }
    func function() -> Void { ... }
    func function() -> () { ... }

-swift calls anonymous functions "closures"
-both named functions and closures have the "save surrounding scope" mechanism. it's not clear whether this works in the global scope
-note that closures are reference types. the saved state is the state surrounding their declaration used within the closure.

-the following wrapper trick allows you to create multiple copies of a function or closure each with a distinct state saved: 

    func outer_function(_ input_state: Int) -> (Int) -> Int {
        var saved_state = input_state
        func inner_function(_ param1: Int) -> Int {                 // a new inner function is created each time the outer function is called 
            saved_state += param1
            return saved_state 
        }
        return inner_function
    }
    var value1 = 100
    let bound_function = outer_function(value1) 
    value1 = bound_function(50)                             // 150
    value1 = bound_function(25)                             // 175
    var value2 = 100 
    let bound_function2 = outer_function(value2) 
    value2 = bound_function2(25)                            // 125

-there's conflicting or missing information here - the book says regular functions save state also, but the Stanford professor says only closures and 
    classes are reference types and that the saved state is put on the heap. 
-there's also strange information on how the state is saved. the professor implies that changes to the saved state will be later reflected in the closure
-you'll have to read more in depth on these issues to figure it out 

-the fact closures are reference types, and their saved state is placed on the heap, can sometimes create reference cycles, so beware 
-if you save the state of an object that has a reference to your closure (direct or indirect), you've got a memory cycle 
-you would use the 'unowned' keyword to break a cycle like this (i.e. strong, weak, unowned references) 

-swift is designed to support functional programming through strong typing, the let keyword (for immutability), and first class functions
-it's probably worth studying functional programming while learning swift 
-swift provides common higher-order functions (functions that have a function parameter) used in functional programming: map(), filter(), reduce() 
-map() transforms an arrays contents using a callback & returns a new array 
-filter() filters an array using a callback, and returns a new array with the values that passed the test 
-reduce() reduces the values in an array to a single element using a callback 

    let numbers = [12, 33, 2, 98, 5, 77] 

    // all 3 of these functions have  a callback as the final parameter, so you can use the trailing inline callback syntax 
    let mapped_numbers = numbers.map {
        (x: Int) -> Int in 
        return x * 2 - 3
    }

    let filtered_numbers = numbers.filter {
        (x: Int) -> Bool in 
        return x > 10 
    }

    let reduced_numbers = numbers.reduce(0) {           // the 1st argument is the initial value that you start with, the callback is the 2nd argument
        (accumulator: Int, next_value: Int) -> Int in 
        return accumulator + next_value                 // this callback will just sum up the array
    }

-as? is often used in conditional casting, either with type Any, AnyObject, between parents / children, or casting to protocols: 

    let var1: parent_type = child_type()
    if let var2 = var1 as? parent_type {
        var2.var2method()
    }

-if you wanted to access individual characters of an NSAttributedString, which is an old objective-C type, you must use NSRange: 
    let swift_string = "hello there!" 
    var mutable_attributed_string = NSMutableAttributedString(string: swift_string) 
    let swift_range = swift_string.startIndex..<swift_string.indexOf(" ") 
    let nsrange_object = NSRange(swift_range, in: swift_string) 
    mutable_attributed_string.addAttribute(.strokeColor, value: UIColor.orange, range: nsrange_object)      // makes "hello" orange but not the rest 

-implementing the CustomStringConvertible protocol in your class allows you to override the default of how \() will print your objects

-enums have a variety of syntax: 

    enum animal {
        case dog 
        case cat 
        case rat 
    }
    var var1: animal = animal.dog               // declare & initialize an enum 

    var var2: animal = .cat                     // type inference allows you to use . 

    if var1 == .dog {                           // you can also use type inference in test conditions 
        print("bark!")
    }
    switch var2 {
    case .dog: 
        print("bark!") 
    case .cat: 
        print("meow!") 
    case .rat: 
        print("squeak!")                        // notice the switch is exhaustive on the enum, so a default is not necessary 
    }                                           // if you don't want to cover all the enums cases, use defualt 


-swift enums can have data associated with them. this is most commonly used in storing or transmitting the enum 
-likewise you can convert data back into an enum using the enum constructors automatically provided rawValue parameter: 

    enum animal: Int {                  // associate data of type Int with each enum 
        case dog                        
        case cat                        // by default, Int data will be associated with the cases in ascending order from 0
        case rat                        // String data, in contrast, will associate a string of the case name 
    }
    enum fish: Int {
        case swordfish = 10             // if desired you can explicitly specify the data to associate with the case 
        case whale = 20 
        case trout                      // you can specify the data of some and not others if desired. unspecified cases get the default value
    }

    var var1 = fish.swordfish 
    print("\(var1.rawValue)");          // use .rawValue to access the data 

    var var2 = animal(rawValue: 2);     // recreate a rat 


-enums can have methods in swift 
-all methods in swift have a self argument which refers to the calling instance:

    enum lightbulb{
        case on 
        case off 
        func surface_temp(ambient_temp ambient: Double) -> Double {
            switch self {
                case .on: 
                    return ambient + 150.0 
                case .off: 
                    return ambient 
            }
        }
        mutating func flip_light_switch(){                              // notice if you reassign self you must mark the function as mutating 
            switch self {
                case .on: 
                    self = lightbulb.off 
                case .off: 
                    self = lightbulb.on 
            }
        }
    }
    var bulb = lightbulb.off 
    bulb.flip_light_switch()                                            // the method is called off the individual object, which becomes self  
    let ambient_temp = 77.0 
    var bulbs_temp = bulb.surface_temp(ambient_temp: ambient_temp)


-the above specified values are static, but you can also associate 1 or more values dynamically 
-there's also a bizarre switch syntax that allows you to unpack and use these dynamically associated values in methods 
-you can create recursive enums by associating data of the same type. if you do this, you must use the indirect keyword to move the enum to the heap:

    // enums dynamic data association 
    enum shape {
        case square(side: Int)                                  // the syntax is similar to constructors 
        case rectangle(width: Int, length: Int)
        case point 
    }
    var square1 = shape.square(side: 10)                        // the arguments are required 
    var rectangle1 = shape.rectangle(width: 8, length: 12) 

    // bizarre syntax of unpacking associated data with let 
    func area() -> Double {
        switch self { 
            case let .square(side: side): 
                return side * side 
            case let .rectangle(width: w, height: h):       // let syntax - swift is binding values using pattern matching
                return w * h                                // notice the variable name comes after the : here. why...? just another swift oddity 
            case .point: 
                return 0 
        }
    }

    // recursive enums moved onto the heap with indirect 
    indirect enum family_tree {
        case no_known_parent 
        case one_known_parent(parent_name: String, parent_ancestors: family_tree) 
        case two_known_parents(dad_name: String, dad_ancestors: family_tree, mom_name: String, mom_ancestors: family_tree)
    }
    // you can use indirect on specific cases for optimization purposes
    enum family_tree {
        case no_known_parent 
        indirect case one_known_parent(parent_name: String, parent_ancestors: family_tree) 
        indirect case two_known_parents(dad_name: String, dad_ancestors: family_tree, mom_name: String, mom_ancestors: family_tree)
    }

-main.swift is the typical entry point of the application, apparently. 
-import foundation --> this brings in classes mainly designed to work in & with objective-C 

-structs & enums are passed by value in Swift (in contrast with class objects)
-structs & classes have a variety of syntax: 

    struct rat {
        var legs: Int = 4                               // 4 is a default value here
        var tail: String = "long" 
        var color: String = "white" 
        var speed: String = "stationary"

        mutating func walk(){                           // swift structs can have methods 
            speed = "walking"                           // struct & enum methods must be marked mutating if any of their data is changed (this does not apply to classes)
        }                                               // this is because structs/enums are pass-by-value, and the compiler needs to know if the data must be checked at run time 
    }

    class bat: animal {                                 // inherits from animal
        var wings_length: String = "20 inch"            // default value 
        var color: String

            super.eat()                                 // calls the parents eat 
        }

        func init(_ input_color: String, _ input_speed: String, _ input_wings_length: String?){

            speed = input_speed 
            let unwrapped = input_wings_length {        // not sure if this is the right way to handle the default value issue or not. maybe multiple constructors? book doesn't say much

-the author claims that methods are implemented as nested functions, and you can actually treat them as first-class objects as well: 

    let fly_the_bat = bat.fly           // type is: (inout bat) -> () -> () ... or something like that, check the playground. the last () means it returns nothing 
                                        // remember that inout designates the parameter as pass by reference
    fly_the_bat() 

-so with a mutating method (required w/ a struct or enum) the first parameter referring to self is designated inout, otherwise it's just regular pass by value 


-remember this suble memory cycle: 
    class cat {
        private var eat = {     // variable references a closure, which saves the state of self 
            self.get_up() 
            ...
        }
        private func get_up(){ ... }
    }

    class rat {                 // here is the fix - point a weak pointer to self 
        private var eat = { [weak weak_self = self] in 
            weak_self?.get_up() 
            ...
        }
        private func get_up(){ ... }
    }

-you can nest classes / structs / enums within eachother, apparently
-classes, structs, and enums can all have properties
-properties can be stored, computed, lazy, and observed 
-stored properties can be given a default value
-lazy variables are set to a closure, and their value is computed when they're first accessed
-computed properties, in contrast, use a closure that contains a getter and optional setter. They are recalculated every time they're accessed
-there are also property observers, which are closures called every time the properties value is changed. 
-you cannot use a property observer on a computed property (though you can respond to changes in the getter / setter anyway), but you can observe inherited properties. 
-there are two ways to observe a property: willSet and didSet 
-willSet is called when a property is about to change, didSet is called when the property has changed
-didSet will include 1 argument for the property's previous value, and willSet gives you 1 argument of the property's new value 

-use lazy variables if an assignment operation requires data that's not yet initialized (like self), or to defer intensive processing:

    class bat {
        // property observer
        var age: Int = 0 {
            willSet(new_age) {
                print("happy birthday number \(new_age), bat!")
            }
        }
        var hours_since_meal: Int

        lazy var wingspan: String = {             // lazy variable set to a closure 
            switch self.age {                     // swift wants to know that self is fully initialized, so it demands the variable be marked lazy 
                case 0...1: 
                    return "small"
                case 2...5: 
                    return "medium" 
                case 6...10: 
                    return "large" 
            }
        }()                                       // () is placed at the end of a lazy closure 
    
        // computed property
        var hungry: String = {                    // note that you must use var to declare a computed property, even if it only has a getter 
            get {
                switch hours_since_meal{
                    case 0...4: 
                        return "not hungry" 
                    case 5...8: 
                        return "moderately hungry" 
                    default: 
                        return "very hungry"
                }
            }
            set(new_value){
                switch new_value{
                    case "just_ate": 
                        self.hours_since_meal = 0   // you can set other properties from within a computed property 
                }
            }
        }                                           // there is no () at the end of a computed property 

        init(_ age: Int){
            self.age = age
            self.hungry = "just ate"
        }
    }

-there is also a shorthand getter syntax, where you just return something in one layer of braces. This is for if you are only implementing a getter by itself 

-Swift also supports static variables and static methods. And it supports class variables / methods too, though it isn't obvious what the essential difference is 
-static variables must be directly assigned an initial value (they are not initialized in init) 
-subclasses can't override their parents static methods / properties, but can override methods / properties preceded by the class keyword. read online for details

-the access levels are: 
    open -                  visible and subclassable wherever the module is imported 
    public -                visible wherever the module is imported 
    internal (default) -    within the same module
    fileprivate -           within source file 
    private -               within defining scope 

-access control for a function can't be less restrictive than access control placed on its parameters 

-you can also independently declare access controls for the setting of properties. note that setter access can't be less restrictive than getter access: 
    public(set) 
    internal(set) 
    fileprivate(set) 
    private(set) 

    var internal private(set) variable1 = 10            // sets getter & setter access separately. getter access is internal, but setter access is private 
    var private(set) variable2 = 20                     // you can leave off internal since it's the default, and the same thing results
