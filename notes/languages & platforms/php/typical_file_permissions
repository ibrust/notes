rules of thumb for file permissions on various types of files for a website:

html - chmod 644 (644 makes the world able to read it but only you able to read & write it)
gif/png/jpg - chmod 644 
css - chmod 644 
js - chmod 644 
php - chmod 600 (users dont need read permissions on php files... though he was using suPHP, not sure if it makes a difference)
directory - chmod 711 (users need only execution rights - read writes allows them to see a list of the directories contents, 
                       execution lets them open a file if it's readable)
