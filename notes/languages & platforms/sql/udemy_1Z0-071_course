    SELECT Col# COLUMN2, NAME AS NAME2, TYPE#        /* example renaming a column. the AS keyword is optional but more readable */ 
    FROM COL#;                                 /* you can easily accidentally rename a field if you forget the comma between fields */

the above string is referred to as a quoted identifier.
non-quoted identifiers must start with a letter. 
    they can contain letters, numbers, _, $, and #. 
    they're limited to 30 characters max. 
quoted identifiers can start with a number, and can contain spaces

semicolons are needed at the end of queries. if it's one query it may execute, but if there are multiple it won't work. 
    some IDEs will insert semicolons at the end, but you shouldn't rely on this. 

comments are -- and /* */ 

within the WHERE clause in oracle SQL instead of == you use =


according to AI the logical execution order of SQL statements is: 
    FROM > WHERE > GROUP BY > HAVING > SELECT > DISTINCT > ORDER BY > LIMIT / OFFSET 

but this may not be the actual execution order because the database may optimize the query if it can. 
    there is no guaranteed order, and the phases of a query are complicated.
        your query may be transformed into something else before execution. 
    
    according to the oracle docs the phases of running a query are: 
        Parsing > Transformation > Estimation > Plan generation > Execution
