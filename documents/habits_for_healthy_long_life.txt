1) D-Mannose https://draxe.com/nutrition/d-mannose-uti/
From what I can tell I should eat quite alot (like 20 years, 3 grams a day - may be too hard on the kidneys? 
    maybe spread out dose, eat some kidney boosting foods)
    start doing this in Jan of 2028 
    followup - april 11 2023 - in 13 years start taking 1 d-mannose pill a day (contradictory info but figure out what's best)
        doesn't seem entirely necessary to do it all the time... also only 1 pill a day was recommended here. 
        but it's hard to tell what's accurate. maybe be on the safe side. 

2) collagen ii 

issues (alphabetical order indicates most -> least important): 
1 E) fungal skin infection, intestine issues 
2 G) overstimulation of nervous system, nervous exhaustion 
3 D) joint issues 
4 I) progression of crohn's, constipation
5 C) metabolic disorders 
6 A) restricted breathing
7 H) lung issues (but this most exemplifies the problem, apparently)
8 F) lack of nutrition (absorption issues) including certain amino acids (glycine, serine? gluconic acid? trace minerals)
9 B) lack of exercise and general self-care and maintenance, overworked, overstressed, and exhausted 

10 (added after) also consider switching from cimzia to stellara 


TODO: 
*** every 5.5 years or so.... ketokonazole pill
*** also... try 42 days of consecutive treatment with the pill
### combine with sugar restrictive diet and herbs that treat fungal infection 
### switch off cimzia to stellara 

*** get in shape. this includes running regularly 
*** get out of bed and stay out of bed 
### fix breathing issue 
### stop being so wired

"Collagen type 2 is what our joints are made out of, thus it consists of the amino acids and other ingredients needed for to 
    rebuild and repair our joints.
I recommend taking with MSM and Vitamin C to help trigger collagen synthesis and you have the perfect trio.
There are many types of collagen (i.e. jello is made up of mostly types 1 & 3) and collagen type 2 should be taken by itself 
    because additional types of collagen will compete against each other."
maybe also try Glucosamine
