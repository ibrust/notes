6 php - the language sucks and you would not want to make it your main thing, but it is good to get your foot in the door with 
5 python - the language is very simple, you can do alot of cool things with it, you can play around with it alot... you might even join a new startup 
13 java - it's kind of a boring life and a boring language. you can make good money and have nice things though
