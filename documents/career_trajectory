Given the rise of AI: 
- study math > AI 
- study ethical hacking 
- study cloud computing and maybe network engineering
___________________________

Career Trajectory (2 step plan):    
1) AI/ML Engineer 
2) Ethical Hacking 
3) still study cloud computing / networking but the other two are higher priority right now

Somehow I'm gonna combine those 2 skills...

The direction it's headed in is "Other"... closest thing is "Cyber Security Engineer", followed by "Robotics Specialist".
Maybe something to do with programming the AIs, or ensuring they're secure from other AIs... 
Or pen testing the code produced by AIs... 
Quantum computing is also high on the list.  

Hacking still requires a detailed, comprehensive understanding of coding and exploits.
This is also a field whose need will be increased by the rise of AI, since AI can be leveraged for ethical hacking purposes, but also to find exploits which increases system vulnerability. Furthermore, we will need to validate the security of the code produced by AI. 

This plans effectiveness is scored: 96/100
