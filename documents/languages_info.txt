as prospective main specialties. numbered by preference: 
4 swift - it's easy and you'll make good money working for big companies 
3 kotlin - it's easy, its fun, it makes good money 
14 javascript - you get to interact with design people and you can work remotely, very independently, may even work for yourself 
6 php - the language sucks and you would not want to make it your main thing, but it is good to get your foot in the door with 
5 python - the language is very simple, you can do alot of cool things with it, you can play around with it alot... you might even join a new startup 
13 java - it's kind of a boring life and a boring language. you can make good money and have nice things though
11 c# - you could easily make this your own thing & you'd be the person that knew more than anyone about it, you could make alot of money 
12 c++ - you end up feeling very trapped in life if you go this direction. very isolated 
10 c - you're more of a scientist here. it's a very technical life but you're also free from having to deal with alot of the social obligations 
8 network admin - meet women 
7 database admin - kind of a corporate life that you're not hugely fond of 
9 system admin - you become very proficient, but once you have the skills there's not much more you need. so it's kind of a coasting life
1 cloud engineer - this is just the ultimate shebang. if you want huge and the very best this is what you go for 
2 system architect - very intellectually demanding
